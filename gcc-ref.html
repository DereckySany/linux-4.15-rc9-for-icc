<h3 class="section">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h3>
<a name="index-dialect-options"></a>
<a name="index-language-dialect-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-dialect"></a>

<p>The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler
accepts:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-ANSI-support"></a>
<a name="index-ISO-support"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ansi</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ansi-1"></a>
<p>In C mode, this is equivalent to <samp>-std=c90</samp>. In C++ mode, it is
equivalent to <samp>-std=c++98</samp>.
</p>
<p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style &lsquo;<samp>//</samp>&rsquo; comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.
</p>
<p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<samp>-ansi</samp>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <samp>-ansi</samp>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <samp>-ansi</samp>.
</p>
<p>The <samp>-ansi</samp> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is required in
addition to <samp>-ansi</samp>.  See <a href="Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.
</p>
<p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <samp>-ansi</samp>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn&rsquo;t call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
</p>
<p>Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in
functions when <samp>-ansi</samp> is used.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other
built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions
affected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-std=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-std-1"></a>
<p>Determine the language standard. See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards
Supported by GCC</a>, for details of these standard versions.  This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.
</p>
<p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as &lsquo;<samp>c90</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>c++98</samp>&rsquo;, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
&lsquo;<samp>gnu90</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>gnu++98</samp>&rsquo;.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
<samp>-std=c90</samp> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code>
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <code>?:</code>
expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
<samp>-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</samp> warns about C++ style &lsquo;<samp>//</samp>&rsquo;
comments, while <samp>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</samp> does not.
</p>
<p>A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

</dd>
<dt><code>-fgnu89-inline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fgnu89-inline"></a>
<p>The option <samp>-fgnu89-inline</samp> tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for <code>inline</code> functions when in C99 mode.
See <a href="Inline.html#Inline">An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro</a>.
Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
<code>gnu_inline</code> function attribute to all inline functions
(see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p>The option <samp>-fno-gnu89-inline</samp> explicitly tells GCC to use the
C99 semantics for <code>inline</code> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).
This option is not supported in <samp>-std=c90</samp> or
<samp>-std=gnu90</samp> mode.
</p>
<p>The preprocessor macros <code>__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__</code> and
<code>__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__</code> may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for <code>inline</code> functions.  See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html#Common-Predefined-Macros">Common Predefined
Macros</a> in <cite>The C Preprocessor</cite>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods"></a>
<a name="index-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods_003dc11"></a>
<a name="index-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods_003dts-18661-3"></a>
<p>ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 defines new permissible values for
<code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> that indicate that operations and constants with
a semantic type that is an interchange or extended format should be
evaluated to the precision and range of that type.  These new values are
a superset of those permitted under C99/C11, which does not specify the
meaning of other positive values of <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code>.  As such, code
conforming to C11 may not have been written expecting the possibility of
the new values.
</p>
<p><samp>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods</samp> specifies whether the compiler
should allow only the values of <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> specified in C99/C11,
or the extended set of values specified in ISO/IEC TS 18661-3.
</p>
<p><var>style</var> is either <code>c11</code> or <code>ts-18661-3</code> as appropriate.
</p>
<p>The default when in a standards compliant mode (<samp>-std=c11</samp> or similar)
is <samp>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=c11</samp>.  The default when in a GNU
dialect (<samp>-std=gnu11</samp> or similar) is
<samp>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=ts-18661-3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-aux-info <var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-aux-info"></a>
<p>Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.
</p>
<p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (&lsquo;<samp>I</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo; for new or
&lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo; for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (&lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo;, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions"></a>
<p>Accept variadic functions without named parameters.
</p>
<p>Although it is possible to define such a function, this is not very
useful as it is not possible to read the arguments.  This is only
supported for C as this construct is allowed by C++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-asm</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-asm"></a>
<p>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <samp>-ansi</samp> implies <samp>-fno-asm</samp>.
</p>
<p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <samp>-fno-gnu-keywords</samp> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<samp>-std=c99</samp> or <samp>-std=gnu99</samp>), this
switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since
<code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-builtin</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-builtin-<var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-builtin"></a>
<a name="index-built-in-functions"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
&lsquo;<samp>__builtin_</samp>&rsquo; as prefix.  See <a href="Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins">Other built-in
functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <samp>-ansi</samp> or
<samp>-std</samp> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.
</p>
<p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <samp>-Wformat</samp> for bad calls to
<code>printf</code> when <code>printf</code> is built in and <code>strlen</code> is
known not to modify global memory.
</p>
<p>With the <samp>-fno-builtin-<var>function</var></samp> option
only the built-in function <var>function</var> is
disabled.  <var>function</var> must not begin with &lsquo;<samp>__builtin_</samp>&rsquo;.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<samp>-fbuiltin-<var>function</var></samp> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <samp>-fno-builtin</samp> or
<samp>-ffreestanding</samp>, you may define macros such as:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fgimple</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fgimple"></a>

<p>Enable parsing of function definitions marked with <code>__GIMPLE</code>.
This is an experimental feature that allows unit testing of GIMPLE
passes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fhosted</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fhosted"></a>
<a name="index-hosted-environment-1"></a>

<p>Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
<samp>-fbuiltin</samp>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return
type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <samp>-fno-freestanding</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffreestanding</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffreestanding-1"></a>
<a name="index-hosted-environment-2"></a>

<p>Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
implies <samp>-fno-builtin</samp>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <code>main</code>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to <samp>-fno-hosted</samp>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Standards.html#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fopenacc</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fopenacc"></a>
<a name="index-OpenACC-accelerator-programming"></a>
<p>Enable handling of OpenACC directives <code>#pragma acc</code> in C/C++ and
<code>!$acc</code> in Fortran.  When <samp>-fopenacc</samp> is specified, the
compiler generates accelerated code according to the OpenACC Application
Programming Interface v2.0 <a href="https://www.openacc.org">https://www.openacc.org</a><!-- /@w -->.  This option
implies <samp>-pthread</samp>, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for <samp>-pthread</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fopenacc-dim=<var>geom</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fopenacc-dim"></a>
<a name="index-OpenACC-accelerator-programming-1"></a>

not explicitly specify.  The <var>geom</var> value is a triple of
&rsquo;:&rsquo;-separated sizes, in order &rsquo;gang&rsquo;, &rsquo;worker&rsquo; and, &rsquo;vector&rsquo;.  A size
can be omitted, to use a target-specific default value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fopenmp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fopenmp"></a>
<a name="index-OpenMP-parallel"></a>
<p>Enable handling of OpenMP directives <code>#pragma omp</code> in C/C++ and
<code>!$omp</code> in Fortran.  When <samp>-fopenmp</samp> is specified, the
compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v4.5 <a href="http://www.openmp.org/">http://www.openmp.org/</a><!-- /@w -->.  This option
implies <samp>-pthread</samp>, and thus is only supported on targets that
have support for <samp>-pthread</samp>. <samp>-fopenmp</samp> implies
<samp>-fopenmp-simd</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fopenmp-simd</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fopenmp-simd"></a>
<a name="index-OpenMP-SIMD"></a>
<a name="index-SIMD"></a>
<p>Enable handling of OpenMP&rsquo;s SIMD directives with <code>#pragma omp</code>
in C/C++ and <code>!$omp</code> in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives
are ignored.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fgnu-tm</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fgnu-tm"></a>
<p>When the option <samp>-fgnu-tm</samp> is specified, the compiler
generates code for the Linux variant of Intel&rsquo;s current Transactional
Memory ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).  This is
an experimental feature whose interface may change in future versions
of GCC, as the official specification changes.  Please note that not
all architectures are supported for this feature.

<p>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.
</p>
<p>In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
to previous types declarations.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">typedef int UOW;
struct ABC {
  UOW UOW;
};
</pre></div>

<p>Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  See <a href="Unnamed-Fields.html#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed struct/union
fields within structs/unions</a>, for details.
</p>
<p>Note that this option is off for all targets but x86 
targets using ms-abi.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fplan9-extensions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fplan9-extensions"></a>
<p>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.
</p>
<p>This enables <samp>-fms-extensions</samp>, permits passing pointers to
structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect pointers to
elements of the type of the field, and permits referring to anonymous
fields declared using a typedef.  See <a href="Unnamed-Fields.html#Unnamed-Fields">Unnamed
struct/union fields within structs/unions</a>, for details.  This is only
supported for C, not C++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcond-mismatch"></a>
<p>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flax-vector-conversions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flax-vector-conversions"></a>
<p>Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funsigned-char</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funsigned-char"></a>
<p>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.
</p>
<p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.
</p>
<p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
</p>
<p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsigned-char</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsigned-char"></a>
<p>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that this is equivalent to <samp>-fno-unsigned-char</samp>, which is
the negative form of <samp>-funsigned-char</samp>.  Likewise, the option
<samp>-fno-signed-char</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-funsigned-char</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code></dt>
<dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsigned-bitfields"></a>
<a name="index-funsigned-bitfields"></a>
<a name="index-fno-signed-bitfields"></a>
<a name="index-fno-unsigned-bitfields"></a>
<p>These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsso-struct=<var>endianness</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsso-struct"></a>
<p>Set the default scalar storage order of structures and unions to the
specified endianness.  The accepted values are &lsquo;<samp>big-endian</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>little-endian</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>native</samp>&rsquo; for the native endianness of
the target (the default).  This option is not supported for C++.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp>-fsso-struct</samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without it if the
specified endianness is not the native endianness of the target.

<a name="Options-Controlling-C_002b_002b-Dialect"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b"></a>
<a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command-line"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b"></a>
<p>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <samp>firstClass.C</samp> like this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, only <samp>-fstrict-enums</samp> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.
</p>
<p>Some options for compiling C programs, such as <samp>-std</samp>, are also
relevant for C++ programs.
See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.
</p>
<p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fabi-version=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fabi-version"></a>
<p>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.
</p>
<p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.
</p>
<p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
</p>
<p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.
</p>
<p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
</p>
<p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
</p>
<p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
</p>
<p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and &ndash;, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
</p>
<p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.
</p>
<p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.
</p>
<p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code>nullptr_t</code>.
</p>
<p>Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. &lsquo;<samp>stdcall</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies <samp>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</samp>.
</p>
<p>See also <samp>-Wabi</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fabi-compat-version"></a>
<p>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fabi-version=0</samp> (the default), this defaults to 8 (GCC 5
compatibility).  If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <samp>-fabi-compat-version=2</samp>.
</p>
<p>If this option is not provided but <samp>-Wabi=<var>n</var></samp> is, that
version is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is provided
along with <samp>-Wabi</samp> (without the version), the version from this
option is used for the warning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-access-control</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-access-control"></a>
<p>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-faligned-new</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-faligned-new"></a>
<p>Enable support for C++17 <code>new</code> of types that require more
alignment than <code>void* ::operator new(std::size_t)</code> provides.  A
numeric argument such as <code>-faligned-new=32</code> can be used to
specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function,
but few users will need to override the default of
<code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code>.
</p>
<p>This flag is enabled by default for <samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcheck-new</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcheck-new"></a>
<p>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared
<code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
&lsquo;<samp>new (nothrow)</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconcepts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fconcepts"></a>
<p>Enable support for the C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical
Specification, ISO 19217 (2015), which allows code like
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool Addable = requires (T t) { t + t; };
template &lt;Addable T&gt; T add (T a, T b) { return a + b; }
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fconstexpr-depth"></a>
<p>Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fconstexpr-loop-limit"></a>
<p>Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect infinite loops during
constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdeduce-init-list</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdeduce-init-list"></a>
<p>Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
<code>std::initializer_list</code> from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
{
  return realfn (t);
}

void f()
{
  forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
}
</pre></div>

<p>This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffriend-injection</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffriend-injection"></a>
<p>Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual.  
However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  GCC defaults to the standard behavior.
</p>
<p>This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-elide-constructors"></a>
<p>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.
</p>
<p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-enforce-eh-specs"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fextern-tls-init"></a>
<a name="index-fno-extern-tls-init"></a>
<p>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and
<code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn&rsquo;t actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp> option.
</p>
<p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<samp>-fextern-tls-init</samp>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffor-scope</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffor-scope"></a>
<a name="index-fno-for-scope"></a>
<p>If <samp>-ffor-scope</samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <code>for</code> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard.
If <samp>-fno-for-scope</samp> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.
</p>
<p>This option is deprecated and the associated non-standard
functionality will be removed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-gnu-keywords"></a>
<p>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead.
This option is implied by the strict ISO C++ dialects: <samp>-ansi</samp>,
<samp>-std=c++98</samp>, <samp>-std=c++11</samp>, etc.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-implicit-templates"></a>
<p>Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-implicit-inline-templates"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-implement-inlines"></a>
<p>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fms-extensions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fms-extensions-1"></a>
<p>Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fnew-inheriting-ctors"></a>
<p>Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11 constructor
inheritance.  This is part of C++17 but also considered to be a Defect
Report against C++11 and C++14.  This flag is enabled by default
unless <samp>-fabi-version=10</samp> or lower is specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnew-ttp-matching</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fnew-ttp-matching"></a>
<p>Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template
parameters and default arguments: this allows a template with default
template arguments as an argument for a template template parameter
with fewer template parameters.  This flag is enabled by default for
<samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-nonansi-builtins"></a>
<p>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnothrow-opt</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fnothrow-opt"></a>
<p>Treat a <code>throw()</code> exception specification as if it were a
<code>noexcept</code> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to <code>terminate</code> rather than <code>unexpected</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-operator-names"></a>
<p>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-optional-diags"></a>
<p>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpermissive</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpermissive"></a>
<p>Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <samp>-fpermissive</samp> allows some
nonconforming code to compile.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-pretty-templates</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-pretty-templates"></a>
<p>When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <code>void f(T) [with T = int]</code>
rather than <code>void f(int)</code>) so that it&rsquo;s clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <samp>-fno-pretty-templates</samp> to disable them.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-frepo</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-frepo"></a>
<p>Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <samp>-fno-implicit-templates</samp>.  See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

<dt><code>-fno-rtti</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-rtti"></a>
<p>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).  If you don&rsquo;t use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <code>void *</code> or to
unambiguous base classes.
</p>

void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
</pre></div>
<p>as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object
to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under
<samp>-std=c++14</samp> and above.  The flag <samp>-Wsized-deallocation</samp>
warns about places that might want to add a definition.

<dt><code>-fstrict-enums</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict-enums"></a>
<p>Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.

<dt><code>-fstrong-eval-order</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrong-eval-order"></a>
<p>Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift expressions in
left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment in right-to-left order,
as adopted for C++17.  Enabled by default with <samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
<samp>-fstrong-eval-order=some</samp> enables just the ordering of member
access and shift expressions, and is the default without
<samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
</p>

<dt><code>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftemplate-backtrace-limit"></a>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftemplate-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftemplate-depth"></a>
<p>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-threadsafe-statics</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-threadsafe-statics"></a>
<p>Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++

option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn&rsquo;t need to be
thread-safe.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fuse-cxa-atexit</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fuse-cxa-atexit"></a>
<p>Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<code>__cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the <code>atexit</code> function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
<code>__cxa_atexit</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use the <code>__cxa_get_exception_ptr</code> runtime routine.  This
causes <code>std::uncaught_exception</code> to be incorrect, but is necessary
if the runtime routine is not available.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"></a>
<p>This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
</p>
<p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<code>__attribute__ ((visibility (&quot;hidden&quot;)))</code> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
</p>
<p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
</p>
<p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
</p>
<p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvisibility-ms-compat</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvisibility-ms-compat"></a>
<p>This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC&rsquo;s C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>The flag makes these changes to GCC&rsquo;s linkage model:
</p>
<ol>
<li> It sets the default visibility to <code>hidden</code>, like
<samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp>.

</li><li> Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

</li><li> The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
</li></ol>

<p>In new code it is better to use <samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
</p>
<p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-weak</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-weak"></a>
<p>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.
By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it results in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nostdinc++</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b"></a>
<p>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-Wabi <span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wabi"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-abi"></a>
<p>Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not compatible with
the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Since G++ now defaults to updating the
ABI with each major release, normally <samp>-Wabi</samp> will warn only if
there is a check added later in a release series for an ABI issue
discovered since the initial release.  <samp>-Wabi</samp> will warn about
more things if an older ABI version is selected (with
<samp>-fabi-version=<var>n</var></samp>).
</p>
<p><samp>-Wabi</samp> can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about compatibility with a particular <samp>-fabi-version</samp>
level, e.g. <samp>-Wabi=2</samp> to warn about changes relative to
<samp>-fabi-version=2</samp>.
</p>
<p>If an explicit version number is provided and
<samp>-fabi-compat-version</samp> is not specified, the version number
from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit
version number is provided with this option, but
<samp>-fabi-compat-version</samp> is specified, that version number is
used for ABI warnings.
</p>
<p>Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.
</p>
<p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.
</p>
<p>Known incompatibilities in <samp>-fabi-version=2</samp> (which was the
default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type was
mangled incorrectly:
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">extern int N;
template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}
</pre></div>

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=3</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> SIMD vector types declared using <code>__attribute ((vector_size))</code> were
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.

<p>The mangling was changed in <samp>-fabi-version=4</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> <code>__attribute ((const))</code> and <code>noreturn</code> were mangled as type
qualifiers, and <code>decltype</code> of a plain declaration was folded away.

<p>These mangling issues were fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=5</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic function are
promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing <code>va_arg</code> to complain.
On most targets this does not actually affect the parameter passing
ABI, as there is no way to pass an argument smaller than <code>int</code>.

<p>Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument packs,
<code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code>, prefix increment/decrement, and
a class scope function used as a template argument.
</p>
<p>These issues were corrected in <samp>-fabi-version=6</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled incorrectly, and the
ABI changed the mangling of <code>nullptr_t</code>.

<p>These issues were corrected in <samp>-fabi-version=7</samp>.
</p>
</li><li> When mangling a function type with function-cv-qualifiers, the
un-qualified function type was incorrectly treated as a substitution
candidate.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=8</samp>, the default for GCC 5.1.
</p>
</li><li> <code>decltype(nullptr)</code> incorrectly had an alignment of 1, leading to
unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not affect the ABI of a
function with a <code>nullptr_t</code> parameter, as parameters have a
minimum alignment.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=9</samp>, the default for GCC 5.2.
</p>
</li><li> Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a type, such as
ia32 calling conventions on a function type (stdcall, regparm, etc.),
did not affect the mangled name, leading to name collisions when
function pointers were used as template arguments.

<p>This was fixed in <samp>-fabi-version=10</samp>, the default for GCC 6.1.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For SysV/x86-64, unions with <code>long double</code> members are 
passed in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">union U {
  long double ld;
  int i;
};
</pre></div>

<p><code>union U</code> is always passed in memory.

<dt><code>-Wabi-tag <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wabi-tag"></a>
<a name="index--Wabi-tag"></a>
<p>Warn when a type with an ABI tag is used in a context that does not

<dd><a name="index-Wctor-dtor-privacy"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-ctor-dtor-privacy"></a>
<p>Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no non-private
methods, and there&rsquo;s at least one private member function that isn&rsquo;t
a constructor or destructor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor"></a>
<p>Warn when <code>delete</code> is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wliteral-suffix <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wliteral-suffix"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-literal-suffix"></a>
<p>Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, GCC treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>.
For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  int64_t i64 = 123;
  printf(&quot;My int64: %&quot; PRId64&quot;\n&quot;, i64);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, <code>PRId64</code> is treated as a separate preprocessing token.
</p>
<p>Additionally, warn when a user-defined literal operator is declared with
a literal suffix identifier that doesn&rsquo;t begin with an underscore. Literal
suffix identifiers that don&rsquo;t begin with an underscore are reserved for
future standardization.
</p>
<p>This warning is enabled by default.

<dt><code>-Wlto-type-mismatch</code></dt>

<dt><code>-Wno-narrowing <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wnarrowing"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-narrowing"></a>
<p>For C++11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default,
as required by the standard.  A narrowing conversion from a constant produces
an error, and a narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a warning,
but <samp>-Wno-narrowing</samp> suppresses the diagnostic.
Note that this does not affect the meaning of well-formed code;
narrowing conversions are still considered ill-formed in SFINAE contexts.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-Wnarrowing</samp> in C++98, warn when a narrowing
conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within
&lsquo;<samp>{ }</samp>&rsquo;, e.g.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int
</pre></div>

<p>This flag is included in <samp>-Wall</samp> and <samp>-Wc++11-compat</samp>.

<dt><code>-Wnoexcept <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wnoexcept"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-noexcept"></a>
<p>Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. <code>throw()</code> or <code>noexcept</code>) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
</p>

<dd><a name="index-Wnoexcept-type"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-noexcept-type"></a>
<p>Warn if the C++17 feature making <code>noexcept</code> part of a function
type changes the mangled name of a symbol relative to C++14.  Enabled
by <samp>-Wabi</samp> and <samp>-Wc++17-compat</samp>.
</p>
<p>As an example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">template &lt;class T&gt; void f(T t) { t(); };
void g() noexcept;
void h() { f(g); } 
</pre></div>

<p>In C++14, <code>f</code> calls calls <code>f&lt;void(*)()&gt;</code>, but in
C++17 it calls <code>f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wclass-memaccess <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wclass-memaccess"></a>
<p>Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such as
<code>memset</code> or <code>memcpy</code> is an object of class type, and when writing
into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor
or copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt
virtual table pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may
violate invariants maintained by member functions of the class.  For example,
the call to <code>memset</code> below is undefined because it modifies a non-trivial
class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either initialize
or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate
constructor or assignment operator, if one is available.
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">std::string str = &quot;abc&quot;;
memset (&amp;str, 0, sizeof str);
</pre></div>
<p>The <samp>-Wclass-memaccess</samp> option is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
Explicitly casting the pointer to the class object to <code>void *</code> or
to a type that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses
the warning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wnon-virtual-dtor <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wnon-virtual-dtor"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-non-virtual-dtor"></a>
<p>Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if <samp>-Weffc++</samp> is specified.

<dt><code>-Wregister <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wregister"></a>

<p>Warn on uses of the <code>register</code> storage class specifier, except
when it is part of the GNU <a href="Explicit-Register-Variables.html#Explicit-Register-Variables">Explicit Register Variables</a> extension.
The use of the <code>register</code> keyword as storage class specifier has

</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct A {
  int i;
  int j;
  A(): j (0), i (1) { }
};
</pre></div>

<p>The compiler rearranges the member initializers for <code>i</code>

<ul>
<li> Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes

<dd><a name="index-Wsign-promo"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-sign-promo"></a>
<p>Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wtemplates <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wtemplates"></a>
<p>Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding
rules disallow templates, and this may be used to enforce that rule.
The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so
one can still use the STL.  One may also instantiate or specialize
templates.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wmultiple-inheritance <span class="roman">(C++ and Objective-C++ only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wmultiple-inheritance"></a>
<p>Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base classes.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also define
classes that indirectly use multiple inheritance.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wvirtual-inheritance</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wvirtual-inheritance"></a>
<p>Warn when a class is defined with a virtual direct base class.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may also define
classes that indirectly use virtual inheritance.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wnamespaces</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wnamespaces"></a>
<p>Warn when a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding rules disallow
namespaces, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is
inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so one can still
use the STL.  One may also use using directives and qualified names.

<h3 class="section">3.7 Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</h3>
<a name="index-options-to-control-diagnostics-formatting"></a>
<a name="index-diagnostic-messages"></a>
<a name="index-message-formatting"></a>

<p>Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device&rsquo;s aspect (e.g. its width, &hellip;).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fmessage-length=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmessage-length"></a>
<p>Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about
<var>n</var> characters.  If <var>n</var> is zero, then no line-wrapping is
done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the
default for all front ends.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics-show-location"></a>
<p>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information <em>once</em>; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won&rsquo;t be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</code></dt>
<dd><p>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-color[=<var>WHEN</var>]</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-diagnostics-color</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics-color"></a>
<a name="index-highlight_002c-color"></a>
<a name="index-GCC_005fCOLORS-environment-variable"></a>
<p>Use color in diagnostics.  <var>WHEN</var> is &lsquo;<samp>never</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>always</samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp>auto</samp>&rsquo;.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above <var>WHEN</var> options or also &lsquo;<samp>never</samp>&rsquo;
if <code>GCC_COLORS</code> environment variable isn&rsquo;t present in the environment,
and &lsquo;<samp>auto</samp>&rsquo; otherwise.
&lsquo;<samp>auto</samp>&rsquo; means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms <samp>-fdiagnostics-color</samp> and <samp>-fno-diagnostics-color</samp> are
aliases for <samp>-fdiagnostics-color=always</samp> and
<samp>-fdiagnostics-color=never</samp>, respectively.
</p>
<p>The colors are defined by the environment variable <code>GCC_COLORS</code>.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
&lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; for bold,
&lsquo;<samp>4</samp>&rsquo; for underline,
&lsquo;<samp>5</samp>&rsquo; for blink,
&lsquo;<samp>7</samp>&rsquo; for inverse,
&lsquo;<samp>39</samp>&rsquo; for default foreground color,
&lsquo;<samp>30</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>37</samp>&rsquo; for foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp>90</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>97</samp>&rsquo; for 16-color mode foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp>38;5;0</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>38;5;255</samp>&rsquo;
for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
&lsquo;<samp>49</samp>&rsquo; for default background color,
&lsquo;<samp>40</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>47</samp>&rsquo; for background colors,
&lsquo;<samp>100</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>107</samp>&rsquo; for 16-color mode background colors,
and &lsquo;<samp>48;5;0</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp>48;5;255</samp>&rsquo;
for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.
</p>
<p>The default <code>GCC_COLORS</code> is
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:\
quote=01:fixit-insert=32:fixit-delete=31:\
diff-filename=01:diff-hunk=32:diff-delete=31:diff-insert=32:\
type-diff=01;32
</pre></div>
<p>where &lsquo;<samp>01;31</samp>&rsquo; is bold red, &lsquo;<samp>01;35</samp>&rsquo; is bold magenta,
&lsquo;<samp>01;36</samp>&rsquo; is bold cyan, &lsquo;<samp>32</samp>&rsquo; is green, &lsquo;<samp>34</samp>&rsquo; is blue,
&lsquo;<samp>01</samp>&rsquo; is bold, and &lsquo;<samp>31</samp>&rsquo; is red.
Setting <code>GCC_COLORS</code> to the empty string disables colors.
Supported capabilities are as follows.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>error=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-error-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for error: markers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>warning=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-warning-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for warning: markers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>note=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-note-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for note: markers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>range1=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-range1-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for first additional range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>range2=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-range2-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for second additional range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>locus=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-locus-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for location information, &lsquo;<samp>file:line</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>file:line:column</samp>&rsquo; etc.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>quote=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-quote-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for information printed within quotes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>fixit-insert=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fixit-insert-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to
be inserted or replaced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>fixit-delete=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fixit-delete-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to
be deleted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff-filename=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-diff-filename-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for filename headers within generated patches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff-hunk=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-diff-hunk-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for the starts of hunks within generated patches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff-delete=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-diff-delete-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for deleted lines within generated patches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>diff-insert=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-diff-insert-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for inserted lines within generated patches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>type-diff=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-type-diff-GCC_005fCOLORS-capability"></a>
<p>SGR substring for highlighting mismatching types within template
arguments in the C++ frontend.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-diagnostics-show-option"></a>
<a name="index-fdiagnostics-show-option"></a>
<p>By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
<samp>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</samp> flag suppresses that behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-diagnostics-show-caret"></a>
<a name="index-fdiagnostics-show-caret"></a>
<p>By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line
and a caret &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; indicating the column.  This option suppresses this
information.  The source line is truncated to <var>n</var> characters, if
the <samp>-fmessage-length=n</samp> option is given.  When the output is done
to the terminal, the width is limited to the width given by the
<code>COLUMNS</code> environment variable or, if not set, to the terminal width.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits"></a>
<p>Emit fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable for consumption
by IDEs.  For each fix-it, a line will be printed after the relevant
diagnostic, starting with the string &ldquo;fix-it:&rdquo;.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">fix-it:&quot;test.c&quot;:{45:3-45:21}:&quot;gtk_widget_show_all&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of
bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.  In the above example,
bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of &ldquo;test.c&rdquo; are to be replaced with the
given string:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">00000000011111111112222222222
12345678901234567890123456789
  gtk_widget_showall (dlg);
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  gtk_widget_show_all
</pre></div>

<p>The filename and replacement string escape backslash as &ldquo;\\&quot;, tab as &ldquo;\t&rdquo;,
newline as &ldquo;\n&rdquo;, double quotes as &ldquo;\&quot;&rdquo;, non-printable characters as octal
(e.g. vertical tab as &ldquo;\013&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>An empty replacement string indicates that the given range is to be removed.
An empty range (e.g. &ldquo;45:3-45:3&rdquo;) indicates that the string is to
be inserted at the given position.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-generate-patch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics-generate-patch"></a>
<p>Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after any diagnostics
are printed.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">--- test.c
+++ test.c
@ -42,5 +42,5 @

 void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
 {
-  gtk_widget_showall(dlg);
+  gtk_widget_show_all(dlg);
 }

</pre></div>

<p>The diff may or may not be colorized, following the same rules
as for diagnostics (see <samp>-fdiagnostics-color</samp>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree"></a>

<p>In the C++ frontend, when printing diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, such as:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
    from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>the <samp>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</samp> flag enables printing a
tree-like structure showing the common and differing parts of the types,
such as:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  map&lt;
    [...],
    vector&lt;
      [double != float]&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The parts that differ are highlighted with color (&ldquo;double&rdquo; and
&ldquo;float&rdquo; in this case).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-elide-type</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-elide-type"></a>
<a name="index-felide-type"></a>
<p>By default when the C++ frontend prints diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, common parts of the types are printed as &ldquo;[...]&rdquo; to
simplify the error message.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
    from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Specifying the <samp>-fno-elide-type</samp> flag suppresses that behavior.
This flag also affects the output of the
<samp>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</samp> flag.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-show-column</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-show-column"></a>
<p>Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as <code>dejagnu</code>.
</p>
</dd>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</p>
<p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-syntax-checking"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsyntax-only"></a>
<p>Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t do anything beyond that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmax-errors=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmax-errors"></a>
<p>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> is also
specified, then <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> takes precedence over this
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-w</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-w"></a>
<p>Inhibit all warning messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-error"></a>
<p>Make all warnings into errors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-error_003d"></a>
<p>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp>-Werror=switch</samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp>-Wswitch</samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp>-Werror</samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp>-Wno-error=switch</samp> makes
<samp>-Wswitch</samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp>-Werror</samp>
is in effect.
</p>
<p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp>-Werror=</samp> and <samp>-Wno-error=</samp> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</samp> flag.)
</p>
<p>Note that specifying <samp>-Werror=</samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp>-W</samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp>-Wno-error=</samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wfatal-errors"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-fatal-errors"></a>
<p>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp>-W</samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp>-Wimplicit</samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp>-Wno-</samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp>-Wno-implicit</samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
</p>
<p>Some options, such as <samp>-Wall</samp> and <samp>-Wextra</samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp>-Wunused</samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp>-Wunused-value</samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.
</p>
<p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp>-Wunknown-warning</samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp>-Wno-</samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp>-Wno-unknown-warning</samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp>-Wno-</samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code></dt>
<dt><code>-pedantic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wpedantic"></a>
<p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp>-std</samp> option used.
</p>
<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp>-ansi</samp> or a
<samp>-std</samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wpedantic</samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp>__</samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.
</p>
<p>Some users try to use <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
</p>
<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>.  We don&rsquo;t have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
</p>
<p>Where the standard specified with <samp>-std</samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp>gnu90</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>gnu99</samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-errors-1"></a>
<p>Give an error whenever the <em>base standard</em> (see <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp>-Werror=pedantic</samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wall</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wall"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-all"></a>
<p>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective-C-and-Objective-C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

<p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp>-Wall</samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp>-Wextra</samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-gen</samp> and

<p>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp>-ffreestanding</samp> or <samp>-fno-builtin</samp>.
</p>
<p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library&rsquo;s limitations.  However, if <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is used
with <samp>-Wformat</samp>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

that such arguments are ignored.
</p>
<p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

<a name="index-Wno-format-overflow"></a>
<p>Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as <code>sprintf</code>
and <code>vsprintf</code> that might overflow the destination buffer.  When the
exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot be determined
at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the
<var>level</var> argument and on optimization.  While enabling optimization
will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning, it may also
result in false positives.

<dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=1</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wformat-overflow-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-format-overflow-1"></a>
<p>Level <var>1</var> of <samp>-Wformat-overflow</samp> enabled by <samp>-Wformat</samp>
employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive&rsquo;s precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <code>sprintf</code>
below is diagnosed because even with both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> equal to zero,
the terminating NUL character (<code>'\0'</code>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (int a, int b)
{
  char buf [12];
  sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %i, b = %i\n&quot;, a, b);
}
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=2</code></dt>
<dd><p>Level <var>2</var> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<var>2</var>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive&rsquo;s precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.
</p>
<p>At level <var>2</var>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <var>a</var> equal to a 32-bit <code>INT_MIN</code> the first
<code>%i</code> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.
</p>
<p>An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <code>short int</code> type then using either the <code>%hi</code> format
directive or casting the argument to <code>short</code> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.

<p>Warn when a switch case falls through.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    a = 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    a = 2;
  case 3:
    a = 3;
    break;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case cannot
fall through, e.g. when there is a return statement or a call to function
declared with the noreturn attribute.  <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</samp>
also takes into account control flow statements, such as ifs, and only
warns when appropriate.  E.g.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    if (i &gt; 3) {
      bar (5);
      break;
    } else if (i &lt; 1) {
      bar (0);
    } else
      return;
  default:
    &hellip;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable,
GCC provides an attribute, <code>__attribute__ ((fallthrough))</code>, that is
to be used along with a null statement to suppress this warning that
would normally occur:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    bar (0);
    __attribute__ ((fallthrough));
  default:
    &hellip;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</samp>
warning using <code>[[fallthrough]];</code> instead of the GNU attribute.  In C++11
or C++14 users can use <code>[[gnu::fallthrough]];</code>, which is a GNU extension.
Instead of these attributes, it is also possible to add a fallthrough comment
to silence the warning.  The whole body of the C or C++ style comment should
match the given regular expressions listed below.  The option argument <var>n</var>
specifies what kind of comments are accepted:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</samp> disables the warning altogether.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=1</samp> matches <code>.*</code> regular
expression, any comment is used as fallthrough comment.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=2</samp> case insensitively matches
<code>.*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).*</code> regular expression.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</samp> case sensitively matches one of the
following regular expressions:

<ul>
<li> <code>-fallthrough</code>

</li><li> <code>[ \t.!]*([Ee]lse,? |[Ii]ntentional(ly)? )?<br>fall(s | |-)?thr(ough|u)[ \t.!]*(-[^\n\r]*)?</code>

</li></ul>

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=4</samp> case sensitively matches one of the
following regular expressions:

<ul>
<li> <code>-fallthrough</code>

</li><li> <code>@fallthrough@</code>

</li><li> <code>lint -fallthrough[ \t]*</code>

</li><li> <code>[ \t]*FALLTHR(OUGH|U)[ \t]*</code>

</li></ul>

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5</samp> doesn&rsquo;t recognize any comments as
fallthrough comments, only attributes disable the warning.

</li></ul>

<p>The comment needs to be followed after optional whitespace and other comments
by <code>case</code> or <code>default</code> keywords or by a user label that precedes some
<code>case</code> or <code>default</code> label.

since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or <code>void</code>.
ISO C prohibits qualified <code>void</code> return types on function

<p>Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure.
Specifically, a warning is issued for <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and
<code>for</code> clauses with a guarded statement that does not use braces,
followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the call to &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is misleadingly indented as
if it were guarded by the &ldquo;if&rdquo; conditional.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  if (some_condition ())
    foo ();
    bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the &quot;if&quot;.  */
</pre></div>

<p>In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the
<samp>-ftabstop=</samp> option to determine if the statements line up
(defaulting to 8).
</p>
<p>The warning is not issued for code involving multiline preprocessor logic
such as the following example.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">  if (flagA)
    foo (0);
#if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
  if (flagB)
#endif
    foo (1);
</pre></div>

<p>The warning is not issued after a <code>#line</code> directive, since this
typically indicates autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be made
about the layout of the file that the directive references.

<p>Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded
by a clause such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>, or
<code>while</code>, in which only the first statement is actually guarded after
the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT x++; y++
if (c)
  DOIT;
</pre></div>

<p>will increment <code>y</code> unconditionally, not just when <code>c</code> holds.
The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while loop:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
if (c)
  DOIT;
</pre></div>

<p>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
</p>
<p>Also warn if a comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is
equivalent to <code>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</code>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</p>
<p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<code>?:</code> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <code>?</code>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
</p>
<p>For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  // Declares a local variable called mymutex.
  std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex);
  // User meant std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex);

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wsequence-point</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wsequence-point"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-sequence-point"></a>
<p>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.
</p>
<p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence points</em>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
</p>
<p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
</p>
<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
</p>
<p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C++.
</p>
<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

<p>For an automatic (i.e.&nbsp;local) variable, if there exists a path from the

some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time.
</p>
<p>These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
GCC does not keep track of the state of variables.
</p>
<p>These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

</pre></div>

<p>If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn&rsquo;t know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.
</p>
<a name="index-longjmp-warnings"></a>
<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.
The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
</p>
<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the

Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <samp>-O</samp> 
works.
<samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</samp>.
</p>
<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 3 (default for <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

<dd><a name="index-Wstrict-overflow"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-strict-overflow"></a>
<p>This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
</p>
<p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

<p>Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as <code>memcpy</code> and
<code>strcpy</code> that are determined to overflow the destination buffer.  The
optional argument is one greater than the type of Object Size Checking to
perform to determine the size of the destination.  See <a href="Object-Size-Checking.html#Object-Size-Checking">Object Size Checking</a>.
The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays
but not for raw memory functions like <code>memcpy</code> which always make use
of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size
in excess of the largest possible object or at most <code>SIZE_MAX / 2</code> bytes.
The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the GCC built-in functions like <code>__builtin_memcpy</code> that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins.  For example, the option will issue a warning for
the <code>strcpy</code> call below because it copies at least 5 characters

<p>Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as <code>strncat</code>,
<code>strncpy</code>, and <code>stpncpy</code> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncat</code> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <code>bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)</code> as the bound.

<p>As another example, the following call to <code>strncpy</code> results in copying
to <code>d</code> just the characters preceding the terminating NUL, without
appending the NUL to the end.  Assuming the result of <code>strncpy</code> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <code>memcpy</code> instead.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (char *d, const char *s)
{
  strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncpy</code> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <code>sizeof buf - 1</code> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <code>NUL</code>.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (const char *s)

</p>
<p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be

forms of the functions <code>aligned_alloc</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>calloc</code>,
<code>malloc</code>, and <code>realloc</code>.  Because the behavior of these functions

<p>This option warns on all uses of <code>alloca</code> in the source.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Walloca-larger-than=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>This option warns on calls to <code>alloca</code> that are not bounded by a
controlling predicate limiting its argument of integer type to at most
<var>n</var> bytes, or calls to <code>alloca</code> where the bound is unknown.
Arguments of non-integer types are considered unbounded even if they
appear to be constrained to the expected range.
</p>
<p>For example, a bounded case of <code>alloca</code> could be:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (size_t n)
{
  void *p;
  if (n &lt;= 1000)
    p = alloca (n);
  else
    p = malloc (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, passing <code>-Walloca-larger-than=1000</code> would not
issue a warning because the call to <code>alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.
</p>
<p>Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <code>alloca</code> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func ()
{
  void *p = alloca (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.
</p>
<p>Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (signed int n)
{
  if (n &lt; 500)
    {
      p = alloca (n);
      f (p);
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, <var>n</var> could be negative, causing a larger than
expected argument to be implicitly cast into the <code>alloca</code> call.
</p>
<p>This option also warns when <code>alloca</code> is used in a loop.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for

<p>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
</p>
<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that&rsquo;s a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

<p>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

</li><li> In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp>-Wtraditional</samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

</li><li> A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

</li><li> The unary plus operator.

</li><li> The &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp>_MIN</samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp>_MAX</samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC&rsquo;s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

</li><li> A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

</li><li> A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

</li><li> A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

</li><li> The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

</li><li> Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

</li><li> Initialization of automatic aggregates.

</li><li> Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

</li><li> Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

</li><li> Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp>-Wtraditional-conversion</samp>.

</li><li> Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty&rsquo;s traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

<dd><a name="index-Wshadow_003dcompatible-local"></a>
<p>Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In C++,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
  {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>Since the two variable <code>i</code> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <samp>-Wshadow=compatible-local</samp> will not emit a warning.
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.

<p>Warn when a function pointer is cast to an incompatible function pointer.
In a cast involving function types with a variable argument list only
the types of initial arguments that are provided are considered.
Any parameter of pointer-type matches any other pointer-type.  Any benign
differences in integral types are ignored, like <code>int</code> vs. <code>long</code>
on ILP32 targets.  Likewise type qualifiers are ignored.  The function
type <code>void (*) (void)</code> is special and matches everything, which can

<p>Warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous

a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple
translation units would be an ODR violation because the meaning of B
is different in each translation unit.  If A only appears in a single
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The

<p>In C/C++, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible

often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code>
can belong to the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code
looks like this:

<p>Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
<code>void func(void); if (func)</code>, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as <code>if (x == &quot;abc&quot;)</code>.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use <code>strcmp</code>.  This warning is enabled by

<p>In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <em>normalization rules</em> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
</p>
<p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfc</samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <em>NFC</em>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp>-Wnormalized</samp>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there&rsquo;s no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<samp>-Wnormalized=id</samp> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
</p>
<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp>-Wnormalized=none</samp> or <samp>-Wno-normalized</samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
&ldquo;D&rdquo;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.
</p>
<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfkc</samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC&rsquo;s optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wpointer-sign <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wpointer-sign"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-pointer-sign"></a>
<p>Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<samp>-Wall</samp> and by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, which can be disabled with
<samp>-Wno-pointer-sign</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wstack-protector</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wstack-protector"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-stack-protector"></a>
<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstack-protector</samp> is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Woverlength-strings</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Woverlength-strings"></a>
<a name="index-Wno-overlength-strings"></a>
<p>Warn about string constants that are longer than the &ldquo;minimum
maximum&rdquo; length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard&rsquo;s minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
</p>
<p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
</p>
<p>This option is implied by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, and can be disabled with
<samp>-Wno-overlength-strings</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wunsuffixed-float-constants <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wunsuffixed-float-constants"></a>

<p>Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <samp>-Wsystem-headers</samp> it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the <code>FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64</code> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-designated-init <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to initialize
a structure that has been marked with the <code>designated_init</code>
attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Whsa</code></dt>
<dd><p>Issue a warning when HSAIL cannot be emitted for the compiled function or
OpenMP construct.

<a name="Options-for-Debugging-Your-Program"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program</h3>
<a name="index-options_002c-debugging"></a>
<a name="index-debugging-information-options"></a>

<p>To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost 
all cases you need only to add <samp>-g</samp> to your other options.
</p>
<p>GCC allows you to use <samp>-g</samp> with
<samp>-O</samp>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
</p>
<p>If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
using <samp>-Og</samp> (see <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>) with <samp>-g</samp>.  
With no <samp>-O</samp> option at all, some compiler passes that collect
information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that
<samp>-Og</samp> may result in a better debugging experience.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-g</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-g"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in the operating system&rsquo;s native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
</p>
<p>On most systems that use stabs format, <samp>-g</samp> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <samp>-gstabs+</samp>, <samp>-gstabs</samp>,
<samp>-gxcoff+</samp>, <samp>-gxcoff</samp>, or <samp>-gvms</samp> (see below).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ggdb</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ggdb"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gdwarf</code></dt>
<dt><code>-gdwarf-<var>version</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gdwarf"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
The value of <var>version</var> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version
for most targets is 4.  DWARF Version 5 is only experimental.
</p>
<p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.
</p>
<p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <samp>-fvar-tracking-assignments</samp>
for maximum benefit.
</p>
<p>GCC no longer supports DWARF Version 1, which is substantially
different than Version 2 and later.  For historical reasons, some
other DWARF-related options such as
<samp>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</samp>) retain a reference to DWARF Version 2
in their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of DWARF.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gstabs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gstabs"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gstabs+</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gstabs_002b"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gxcoff</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gxcoff"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported).
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gxcoff+</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gxcoff_002b"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gvms</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gvms"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on Alpha/VMS systems.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-g<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-ggdb<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-gstabs<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-gxcoff<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-gvms<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
</p>
<p>Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <samp>-g0</samp> negates
<samp>-g</samp>.
</p>
<p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don&rsquo;t plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.
</p>
<p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <samp>-g3</samp>.
</p>
<p><samp>-gdwarf</samp> does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid
confusion with <samp>-gdwarf-<var>level</var></samp>.
Instead use an additional <samp>-g<var>level</var></samp> option to change the
debug level for DWARF.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols"></a>
<p>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
for only symbols that are actually used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-femit-class-debug-always</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-femit-class-debug-always"></a>
<p>Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-merge-debug-strings</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge-debug-strings"></a>
<a name="index-fno-merge-debug-strings"></a>
<p>Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is
not supported by all assemblers or linkers.  Merging decreases the size
of the debug information in the output file at the cost of increasing
link processing time.  Merging is enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdebug-prefix-map=<var>old</var>=<var>new</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdebug-prefix-map"></a>
<p>When compiling files residing in directory <samp><var>old</var></samp>, record
debugging information describing them as if the files resided in
directory <samp><var>new</var></samp> instead.  This can be used to replace a
build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.  It can
also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using
<samp>.</samp> for <var>new</var>.  This can give more reproducible builds, which
are location independent, but may require an extra command to tell GDB
where to find the source files. See also <samp>-ffile-prefix-map</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvar-tracking"></a>
<p>Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each
position in code.  Better debugging information is then generated
(if the debugging information format supports this information).
</p>
<p>It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization (<samp>-Os</samp>,
<samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, &hellip;), debugging information (<samp>-g</samp>) and
the debug info format supports it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking-assignments</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvar-tracking-assignments"></a>
<a name="index-fno-var-tracking-assignments"></a>
<p>Annotate assignments to user variables early in the compilation and
attempt to carry the annotations over throughout the compilation all the
way to the end, in an attempt to improve debug information while
optimizing.  Use of <samp>-gdwarf-4</samp> is recommended along with it.
</p>
<p>It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which case
annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at the end.
By default, this flag is enabled together with <samp>-fvar-tracking</samp>,
except when selective scheduling is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gsplit-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gsplit-dwarf"></a>
<p>Separate as much DWARF debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension <samp>.dwo</samp>.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading <samp>.dwo</samp>
files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gpubnames</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gpubnames"></a>
<p>Generate DWARF <code>.debug_pubnames</code> and <code>.debug_pubtypes</code> sections.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ggnu-pubnames</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ggnu-pubnames"></a>
<p>Generate <code>.debug_pubnames</code> and <code>.debug_pubtypes</code> sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a GDB&nbsp;index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce GDB&nbsp;index version 7.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdebug-types-section</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdebug-types-section"></a>
<a name="index-fno-debug-types-section"></a>
<p>When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own <code>.debug_types</code> section instead of making them part of the
<code>.debug_info</code> section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all DWARF consumers support <code>.debug_types</code> sections yet
and on some objects <code>.debug_types</code> produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-grecord-gcc-switches</code></dt>
<dt><code>-gno-record-gcc-switches</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-grecord-gcc-switches"></a>
<a name="index-gno-record-gcc-switches"></a>
<p>This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  
It is enabled by default.
See also <samp>-frecord-gcc-switches</samp> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gstrict-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gstrict-dwarf"></a>
<p>Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected
with <samp>-gdwarf-<var>version</var></samp>.  On most targets using non-conflicting
DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gno-strict-dwarf</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gno-strict-dwarf"></a>
<p>Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with
<samp>-gdwarf-<var>version</var></samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gcolumn-info</code></dt>
<dt><code>-gno-column-info</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gcolumn-info"></a>
<a name="index-gno-column-info"></a>
<p>Emit location column information into DWARF debugging information, rather
than just file and line.
This option is enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gstatement-frontiers</code></dt>
<dt><code>-gno-statement-frontiers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gstatement-frontiers"></a>
<a name="index-gno-statement-frontiers"></a>
<p>This option causes GCC to create markers in the internal representation
at the beginning of statements, and to keep them roughly in place
throughout compilation, using them to guide the output of <code>is_stmt</code>
markers in the line number table.  This is enabled by default when
compiling with optimization (<samp>-Os</samp>, <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>,
&hellip;), and outputting DWARF 2 debug information at the normal level.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gz<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>type</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gz"></a>
<p>Produce compressed debug sections in DWARF format, if that is supported.
If <var>type</var> is not given, the default type depends on the capabilities
of the assembler and linker used.  <var>type</var> may be one of
&lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo; (don&rsquo;t compress debug sections), &lsquo;<samp>zlib</samp>&rsquo; (use zlib
compression in ELF gABI format), or &lsquo;<samp>zlib-gnu</samp>&rsquo; (use zlib
compression in traditional GNU format).  If the linker doesn&rsquo;t support
writing compressed debug sections, the option is rejected.  Otherwise,
if the assembler does not support them, <samp>-gz</samp> is silently ignored
when producing object files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-femit-struct-debug-baseonly"></a>
<p>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the struct is defined.
</p>
<p>This option substantially reduces the size of debugging information,
but at significant potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <samp>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</samp> for a less aggressive option.
See <samp>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> for more detailed control.
</p>
<p>This option works only with DWARF debug output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-femit-struct-debug-reduced"></a>
<p>Emit debug information for struct-like types
only when the base name of the compilation source file
matches the base name of file in which the type is defined,
unless the struct is a template or defined in a system header.
</p>
<p>This option significantly reduces the size of debugging information,
with some potential loss in type information to the debugger.
See <samp>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</samp> for a more aggressive option.
See <samp>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> for more detailed control.
</p>
<p>This option works only with DWARF debug output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-femit-struct-debug-detailed<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>spec-list</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-femit-struct-debug-detailed"></a>
<p>Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
</p>
<p>This option is a detailed version of
<samp>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</samp> and <samp>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</samp>,
which serves for most needs.
</p>
<p>A specification has the syntax<br>
[&lsquo;<samp>dir:</samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp>ind:</samp>&rsquo;][&lsquo;<samp>ord:</samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp>gen:</samp>&rsquo;](&lsquo;<samp>any</samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp>sys</samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp>base</samp>&rsquo;|&lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo;)
</p>
<p>The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (&lsquo;<samp>dir:</samp>&rsquo;) or used indirectly (&lsquo;<samp>ind:</samp>&rsquo;).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
&lsquo;<samp>struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (&lsquo;<samp>ord:</samp>&rsquo;) or generic structs (&lsquo;<samp>gen:</samp>&rsquo;).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For C++, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but <samp>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</samp> does not yet implement them.
</p>
<p>The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>any</samp>&rsquo; have the normal meaning.
The value &lsquo;<samp>base</samp>&rsquo; means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling <samp>foo.c</samp>, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and <samp>foo.h</samp>,
but not other header files.
The value &lsquo;<samp>sys</samp>&rsquo; means those types satisfying &lsquo;<samp>base</samp>&rsquo;
or declared in system or compiler headers.
</p>
<p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</samp>.
</p>
<p>This option works only with DWARF debug output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdwarf2-cfi-asm"></a>
<a name="index-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm"></a>
<p>Emit DWARF unwind info as compiler generated <code>.eh_frame</code> section
instead of using GAS <code>.cfi_*</code> directives.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-feliminate-unused-debug-types"></a>
<a name="index-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types"></a>
<p>Normally, when producing DWARF output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.

<a name="Options-That-Control-Optimization"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>
<a name="index-optimize-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-optimization"></a>

<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations.
</p>
<p>Without any optimization option, the compiler&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
</p>
<p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
</p>
<p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
</p>
<p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
</p>
<p>Most optimizations are only enabled if an <samp>-O</samp> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
</p>
<p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <samp>-O</samp> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <samp>-Q --help=optimizers</samp>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
See <a href="Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>, for examples.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-O</code></dt>
<dt><code>-O1</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O"></a>
<a name="index-O1"></a>
<p>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-O</samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
</p>
<p><samp>-O</samp> turns on the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">

</dd>
<dt><code>-O2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O2"></a>
<p>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to <samp>-O</samp>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
</p>
<p><samp>-O2</samp> turns on all optimization flags specified by <samp>-O</samp>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-O3</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O3"></a>
<p>Optimize yet more.  <samp>-O3</samp> turns on all optimizations specified
by <samp>-O2</samp> and also turns on the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-finline-functions

</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-O0</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O0"></a>
<p>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Os</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Os"></a>
<p>Optimize for size.  <samp>-Os</samp> enables all <samp>-O2</samp> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.
</p>
<p><samp>-Os</samp> disables the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
-falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc 
-freorder-blocks-and-partition  -fprefetch-loop-arrays
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Ofast</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Ofast"></a>
<p>Disregard strict standards compliance.  <samp>-Ofast</samp> enables all
<samp>-O3</samp> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs.
It turns on <samp>-ffast-math</samp> and the Fortran-specific
<samp>-fstack-arrays</samp>, unless <samp>-fmax-stack-var-size</samp> is
specified, and <samp>-fno-protect-parens</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Og</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Og"></a>
<p>Optimize debugging experience.  <samp>-Og</samp> enables optimizations
that do not interfere with debugging. It should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If you use multiple <samp>-O</samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</p>
<p>Options of the form <samp>-f<var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp>-ffoo</samp> is <samp>-fno-foo</samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically 
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp>no-</samp>&rsquo;
or adding it.
</p>
<p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp>-O</samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-defer-pop"></a>
<p>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines that must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
</p>
<p>Disabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fforward-propagate</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fforward-propagate"></a>
<p>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <samp>-O</samp>,
<samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffp-contract=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffp-contract"></a>
<p><samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp> disables floating-point expression contraction.
<samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<samp>-ffp-contract=on</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp>.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fomit-frame-pointer"></a>
<p>Omit the frame pointer in functions that don&rsquo;t need one.  This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets
it also makes an extra register available.
</p>
<p>On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard calling sequence
always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be omitted.
</p>
<p>Note that <samp>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</samp> doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the frame pointer
is used in all functions.  Several targets always omit the frame pointer in
leaf functions.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-foptimize-sibling-calls"></a>
<p>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-foptimize-strlen</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-foptimize-strlen"></a>
<p>Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g. <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strchr</code> or <code>strcpy</code>) and
their <code>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code> counterparts into faster alternatives.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-inline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-inline"></a>
<p>Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <code>always_inline</code> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.
</p>
<p>Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <code>noinline</code> attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-small-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline-small-functions"></a>
<p>Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O2</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-findirect-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-findirect-inlining"></a>
<p>Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <samp>-finline-functions</samp>
or <samp>-finline-small-functions</samp> options.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O2</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline-functions"></a>
<p>Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline.
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.
</p>
<p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline-functions-called-once"></a>
<p>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O1</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fearly-inlining"></a>
<p>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-sra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-sra"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline-limit"></a>
<p>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.
</p>
<p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp>--param <var>name</var>=<var>value</var></samp>.
The <samp>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp>-finline-limit</samp> that results
in default behavior.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function&rsquo;s size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-keep-inline-dllexport"></a>
<p>This is a more fine-grained version of <samp>-fkeep-inline-functions</samp>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <code>dllexport</code>
attribute or declspec.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Declaring Attributes of
Functions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep-inline-functions"></a>
<p>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-static-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep-static-functions"></a>
<p>Emit <code>static</code> functions into the object file, even if the function
is never used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep-static-consts"></a>
<p>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn&rsquo;t turned
on, even if the variables aren&rsquo;t referenced.
</p>
<p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp>-fno-keep-static-consts</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge-constants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
</p>
<p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp>-fno-merge-constants</samp> to inhibit this
behavior.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge-all-constants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
</p>
<p>This option implies <samp>-fmerge-constants</samp>.  In addition to
<samp>-fmerge-constants</samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo-sched"></a>
<p>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves"></a>
<p>Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<samp>-fmodulo-sched</samp> enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-branch-count-reg"></a>
<p>Avoid running a pass scanning for opportunities to use &ldquo;decrement and
branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register instead of generating sequences
of instructions that decrement a register, compare it against zero, and
then branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
IA-64 and S/390.  Note that the <samp>-fno-branch-count-reg</samp> option
doesn&rsquo;t remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default at <samp>-O1</samp> and higher.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fbranch-count-reg</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-function-cse"></a>
<p>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function&rsquo;s address explicitly.
</p>
<p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-ffunction-cse</samp>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss"></a>
<p>If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting
code.
</p>
<p>This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section&mdash;e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fthread-jumps</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fthread-jumps"></a>
<p>Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsplit-wide-types</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsplit-wide-types"></a>
<p>When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as <code>long
long</code> on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,

<p>This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed

one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are

<dt><code>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"></a>
<p>Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides at address zero.
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
</p>
<p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use <samp>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</samp> to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios II ELF, it

Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem

<dt><code>-fno-lifetime-dse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-lifetime-dse"></a>
<p>In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use <samp>-flifetime-dse=1</samp>.  The default behavior can be
explicitly selected with <samp>-flifetime-dse=2</samp>.
<samp>-flifetime-dse=0</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-fno-lifetime-dse</samp>.

<dt><code>-fsemantic-interposition</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsemantic-interposition"></a>
<p>Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the

This means that for symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality.
With <samp>-fno-semantic-interposition</samp> the compiler assumes that 
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have 
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag

<dd><a name="index-fipa-ra"></a>
<p>Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(<samp>-p</samp>, or <samp>-pg</samp>) or if callee&rsquo;s register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in RTL).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconserve-stack</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fconserve-stack"></a>
<p>Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the <samp>large-stack-frame</samp> parameter to 100
and the <samp>large-stack-frame-growth</samp> parameter to 400.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-reassoc</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-reassoc"></a>
<p>Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcode-hoisting</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcode-hoisting"></a>
<p>Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-pre</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-pre"></a>
<p>Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This flag is

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-partial-pre</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-partial-pre"></a>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-forwprop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-forwprop"></a>
<p>Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-fre</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-fre"></a>
<p>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-phiprop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-phiprop"></a>
<p>Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fhoist-adjacent-loads"></a>
<p>Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-copy-prop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-copy-prop"></a>
<p>Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and
higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-pure-const</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-pure-const"></a>
<p>Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-reference</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-reference"></a>

compilation unit.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-pta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-pta"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-profile</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-profile"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<code>cold</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-cp"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp> and <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp-clone</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-cp-clone"></a>
<p>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <samp>--param ipcp-unit-growth=<var>value</var></samp>).
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-bit-cp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index--fipa-bit-cp"></a>
<p>When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>. It
requires that <samp>-fipa-cp</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-vrp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index--fipa-vrp"></a>
<p>When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>. It requires
that <samp>-fipa-cp</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-icf</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa-icf"></a>
<p>Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables.
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless the behavior is similar to Gold Linker ICF optimization, GCC ICF
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are
equivalences that are found only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold.
</p>
<p>This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference"></a>
<p>Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to
dereferencing a null pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main control
flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher and depends on
<samp>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</samp> also being enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute"></a>
<p>Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due a null value
being used in a way forbidden by a <code>returns_nonnull</code> or <code>nonnull</code>
attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the
statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.  This is not
currently enabled, but may be enabled by <samp>-O2</samp> in the future.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-bit-ccp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-bit-ccp"></a>
<p>Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ccp</code></dt>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fssa-backprop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fssa-backprop"></a>
<p>Propagate information about uses of a value up the definition chain
in order to simplify the definitions.  For example, this pass strips
sign operations if the sign of a value never matters.  The flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fssa-phiopt</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fssa-phiopt"></a>

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-switch-conversion</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-switch-conversion"></a>
<p>Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-tail-merge</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-tail-merge"></a>
<p>Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using <samp>max-tail-merge-comparisons</samp> parameter and
<samp>max-tail-merge-iterations</samp> parameter.
</p>

<p>Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is enabled by
default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-builtin-call-dce"></a>
<p>Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to built-in functions
that may set <code>errno</code> but are otherwise side-effect free.  This flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher if <samp>-Os</samp> is not also
specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dominator-opts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-dominator-opts"></a>
<p>Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-dse"></a>
<p>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-ch"></a>
<p>Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.  It is not enabled
for <samp>-Os</samp>, since it usually increases code size.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-optimize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-optimize"></a>
<p>Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default

<a name="index-floop-strip-mine"></a>
<a name="index-floop-block"></a>
<p>Perform loop nest optimizations.  Same as
<samp>-floop-nest-optimize</samp>.  To use this code transformation, GCC has
to be configured with <samp>--with-isl</samp> to enable the Graphite loop
transformation infrastructure.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fgraphite-identity</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fgraphite-identity"></a>
<p>Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
<samp>-fgraphite-identity</samp> we can check the costs or benefits of the
GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-nest-optimize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop-nest-optimize"></a>
<p>Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop
structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.  This option
is experimental.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-parallelize-all</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop-parallelize-all"></a>
<p>Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-coalesce-vars</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-coalesce-vars"></a>
<p>While transforming the program out of the SSA representation, attempt to
reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined
variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.  This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
<samp>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</samp>.  In the negated form, this flag
prevents SSA coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-if-convert</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-if-convert"></a>
<p>Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-distribution</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-distribution"></a>
<p>Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  A(I) = B(I) + C
  D(I) = E(I) * F
ENDDO

DO I = 1, N
   D(I) = E(I) * F
ENDDO
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns"></a>
<p>Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
<p>This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  A(I) = 0
  B(I) = A(I) + I
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>is transformed to
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
   A(I) = 0
ENDDO
DO I = 1, N
   B(I) = A(I) + I
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-interchange</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop-interchange"></a>
<p>Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can improve cache
performance on loop nest and allow further loop optimizations, like
vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
  for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
    for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
      c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];
</pre></div>
<p>is transformed to
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
  for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
      c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-im</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-im"></a>
<p>Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <samp>-funswitch-loops</samp> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-ivcanon"></a>
<p>Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fivopts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fivopts"></a>
<p>Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-parallelize-loops"></a>
<p>Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies <samp>-pthread</samp>, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for <samp>-pthread</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-pta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-pta"></a>
<p>Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-sra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-sra"></a>
<p>Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstore-merging</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstore-merging"></a>
<p>Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory addresses.  This pass
merges contiguous stores of immediate values narrower than a word into fewer
wider stores to reduce the number of instructions.  This is enabled by default
at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher as well as <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ter</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-ter"></a>
<p>Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-slsr</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-slsr"></a>
<p>Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and
higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-vectorize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-vectorize"></a>
<p>Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables <samp>-ftree-loop-vectorize</samp>
and <samp>-ftree-slp-vectorize</samp> if not explicitly specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-vectorize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-loop-vectorize"></a>
<p>Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
<samp>-O3</samp> and when <samp>-ftree-vectorize</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-slp-vectorize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-slp-vectorize"></a>
<p>Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
<samp>-O3</samp> and when <samp>-ftree-vectorize</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvect-cost-model=<var>model</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvect-cost-model"></a>
<p>Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The <var>model</var> argument
should be one of &lsquo;<samp>unlimited</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>cheap</samp>&rsquo;.
With the &lsquo;<samp>unlimited</samp>&rsquo; model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; model a runtime check
guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration
counts that will likely execute faster than when executing the original
scalar loop.  The &lsquo;<samp>cheap</samp>&rsquo; model disables vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
either &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>cheap</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsimd-cost-model=<var>model</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsimd-cost-model"></a>
<p>Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP
or Cilk Plus simd directive.  The <var>model</var> argument should be one of
&lsquo;<samp>unlimited</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>cheap</samp>&rsquo;.  All values of <var>model</var>
have the same meaning as described in <samp>-fvect-cost-model</samp> and by
default a cost model defined with <samp>-fvect-cost-model</samp> is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-vrp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree-vrp"></a>
<p>Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if <samp>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</samp> is
enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsplit-paths</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsplit-paths"></a>
<p>Split paths leading to loop backedges.  This can improve dead code
elimination and common subexpression elimination.  This is enabled by
default at <samp>-O2</samp> and above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller"></a>
<p>Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
</p>
<p>A combination of <samp>-fweb</samp> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body
is more complicated than a single basic block.  It also does not work at all
on some architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.
</p>
<p>This optimization is enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller"></a>
<p>With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of some
local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result in superior code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpartial-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpartial-inlining"></a>
<p>Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <samp>-finline-functions</samp>
or <samp>-finline-small-functions</samp> options.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O2</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpredictive-commoning</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpredictive-commoning"></a>
<p>Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing computations
(especially memory loads and stores) performed in previous
iterations of loops.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled at level <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprefetch-loop-arrays"></a>
<p>If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

<p>Do not substitute constants for known return value of formatted output
functions such as <code>sprintf</code>, <code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsprintf</code>, and

transformation allows GCC to optimize or even eliminate branches based
on the known return value of these functions called with arguments that
are either constant, or whose values are known to be in a range that
makes determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when
<samp>-fprintf-return-value</samp> is in effect, both the branch and the
body of the <code>if</code> statement (but not the call to <code>snprint</code>)
can be optimized away when <code>i</code> is a 32-bit or smaller integer

taking the <code>__builtin_expect</code> info into account.  The interactions

<dd><a name="index-fstrict-aliasing"></a>
<p>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

};

int f() {

  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;

</pre></div>
<p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.  See <a href="Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit-fields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit-fields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:
</p><div class="smallexample">

  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &amp;t.i;

}
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
</p><div class="smallexample">

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto[=<var>n</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto"></a>
<p>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC&rsquo;s internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
</p>
<p>To use the link-time optimizer, <samp>-flto</samp> and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.  
For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <samp>foo.o</samp> and
<samp>bar.o</samp>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<samp>bar.o</samp> into functions in <samp>foo.o</samp> and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</pre></div>

<p>The above generates bytecode for <samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>bar.c</samp>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <samp>myprog</samp>.
</p>
<p>The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step.
GCC then automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <samp>-flto</samp> command-line option.  
You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for link-time
optimization though GCC tries to be clever at guessing an
optimization level to use from the options used at compile time
if you fail to specify one at link time.  You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing <samp>-fno-lto</samp> to the link command.
</p>
<p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
</p>
<p>When <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp> is not enabled, when a file is
compiled with <samp>-flto</samp>, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <samp>-ffat-lto-objects</samp>.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <samp>-fno-lto</samp> is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
<samp>-fno-fat-lto-objects</samp> is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -O3 foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary <samp>myprog</samp> is optimized at
<samp>-O3</samp>.  If, instead, the final binary is generated with
<samp>-fno-lto</samp>, then <samp>myprog</samp> is not optimized.
</p>
<p>When producing the final binary, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.
</p>
<p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Generally options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify an optimization level option <samp>-O</samp> at
link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level 
used when compiling the object files.
</p>
<p>Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them: 
<samp>-fPIC</samp>, <samp>-fpic</samp>, <samp>-fpie</samp>, <samp>-fcommon</samp>,
<samp>-fexceptions</samp>, <samp>-fnon-call-exceptions</samp>, <samp>-fgnu-tm</samp>
and all the <samp>-m</samp> target flags.
</p>
<p>Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as <samp>-freg-struct-return</samp>
and <samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp>. 
</p>
<p>Other options such as <samp>-ffp-contract</samp>, <samp>-fno-strict-overflow</samp>,
<samp>-fwrapv</samp>, <samp>-fno-trapv</samp> or <samp>-fno-strict-aliasing</samp>
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
<samp>-fno-strict-overflow</samp>, <samp>-fwrapv</samp> and <samp>-fno-trapv</samp> take
precedence; and for example <samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp> takes precedence
over <samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp>.  You can override them at link time.
</p>
<p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.
</p>
<p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -flto foo.c
g++ -c -flto bar.cc
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the final link is done with <code>g++</code> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <samp>-lgfortran</samp> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.
</p>
<p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<samp>libfoo.a</samp>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for LTO, use <code>gcc-ar</code> and <code>gcc-ranlib</code> instead of <code>ar</code>
and <code>ranlib</code>; 
to show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use
<code>gcc-nm</code>.  Those commands require that <code>ar</code>, <code>ranlib</code>
and <code>nm</code> have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the the
flag <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp> to ensure that the library participates in
the LTO optimization process:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</pre></div>

<p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <samp>libfoo.a</samp> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.
</p>
<p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <samp>libfoo.a</samp>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
<samp>-flto</samp> <samp>-ffat-lto-objects</samp>.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <samp>-flto</samp> and <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>).
</p>
<p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining <samp>-flto</samp> with
<samp>-g</samp> is currently experimental and expected to produce unexpected
results.
</p>
<p>If you specify the optional <var>n</var>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <var>n</var>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <code>make</code> program.  The
environment variable <code>MAKE</code> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <var>n</var> is 1.
</p>
<p>You can also specify <samp>-flto=jobserver</samp> to use GNU make&rsquo;s
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <code>MAKE</code> is
GNU make.

libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <samp>-fwhole-program</samp>.
See <samp>-flto</samp> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffat-lto-objects</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffat-lto-objects"></a>
<p>Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both LTO linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with <samp>-flto</samp>
and is ignored at link time.
</p>
<p><samp>-fno-fat-lto-objects</samp> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
<code>nm</code>, <code>ar</code> and <code>ranlib</code>
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the <code>gcc-ar</code>,
<code>gcc-nm</code>, <code>gcc-ranlib</code> wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to use them.

<p>Before you can use this option, you must first generate profiling information.
See <a href="Instrumentation-Options.html#Instrumentation-Options">Instrumentation Options</a>, for information about the

<p>The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-ffloat-store</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffloat-store"></a>
<p>Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.
</p>
<a name="index-floating-point-precision"></a>
<p>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fexcess-precision=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fexcess-precision"></a>
<p>This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the IEEE standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, <samp>-fexcess-precision=fast</samp> is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.
When compiling C, if <samp>-fexcess-precision=standard</samp> is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <samp>-std=c99</samp> is used.
<samp>-ffast-math</samp> enables <samp>-fexcess-precision=fast</samp> by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.
</p>
<a name="index-mfpmath"></a>
<p><samp>-fexcess-precision=standard</samp> is not implemented for languages
other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if <samp>-mfpmath=sse</samp>
or <samp>-mfpmath=sse+387</samp> is specified; in the former case, IEEE
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.
</p>

<p>This option causes the preprocessor macro <code>__FAST_MATH__</code> to be defined.

<p>Do not set <code>errno</code> after calling math functions that are executed

IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.
</p>

<dt><code>-fassociative-math</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fassociative-math"></a>

<p>Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
<code>(x + 2**52) - 2**52</code>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both <samp>-fno-signed-zeros</samp> and
<samp>-fno-trapping-math</samp> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t make
much sense with <samp>-frounding-math</samp>. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both <samp>-fno-signed-zeros</samp> and
<samp>-fno-trapping-math</samp> are in effect.

<dt><code>-freciprocal-math</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-freciprocal-math"></a>

<p>Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example <code>x / y</code>
can be replaced with <code>x * (1/y)</code>, which is useful if <code>(1/y)</code>
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

<dt><code>-fno-signed-zeros</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-signed-zeros"></a>
<p>Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <samp>-ffinite-math-only</samp>).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn&rsquo;t significant.

</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-trapping-math</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-trapping-math"></a>
<p>Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that <samp>-fno-signaling-nans</samp> be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on &ldquo;non-stop&rdquo; IEEE arithmetic, for example.
</p>
<p>This option should never be turned on by any <samp>-O</samp> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on

<p>Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default floating-point
rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for all floating point
to integer conversions, and round-to-nearest for all other arithmetic
truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

<p>This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by rounding mode.
Future versions of GCC may provide finer control of this setting

allow these functions to raise the &ldquo;inexact&rdquo; exception, but ISO/IEC
TS 18661-1:2014, the C bindings to IEEE 754-2008, does not allow these
functions to do so.

<p>Even if <samp>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</samp> is used, if the functions

<dd><a name="index-fbranch-probabilities"></a>
<p>After running a program compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>
(see <a href="Instrumentation-Options.html#Instrumentation-Options">Instrumentation Options</a>),
you can compile it a second time using
<samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp> exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <samp><var>sourcename</var>.gcda</samp> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

<p>With <samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, GCC puts a
&lsquo;<samp>REG_BR_PROB</samp>&rsquo; note on each &lsquo;<samp>JUMP_INSN</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CALL_INSN</samp>&rsquo;.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only

<p>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use

upon entry to the loop.  <samp>-funroll-loops</samp> implies
<samp>-frerun-cse-after-loop</samp>, <samp>-fweb</samp> and <samp>-frename-registers</samp>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

<p>Enabled with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funroll-all-loops"></a>
<p>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when

</dd>
<dt><code>-funswitch-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funswitch-loops"></a>

<dt><code>-floop-unroll-and-jam</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop-unroll-and-jam"></a>

<a name="index-fdata-sections"></a>
<p>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output

function or the name of the data item determines the section&rsquo;s name
in the output file.
</p>
<p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
ELF object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.
</p>
<p>Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <samp>--gc-sections</samp>
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).
</p>
<p>On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.
</p>
<p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation.
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.

<p>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using

can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some

<p>For example, the implementation of the following function <code>foo</code>:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">static int a, b, c;
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
</pre></div>

<p>usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <samp>-fsection-anchors</samp>, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the

<h3 class="section">3.11 Program Instrumentation Options</h3>
<a name="index-instrumentation-options"></a>
<a name="index-program-instrumentation-options"></a>
<a name="index-run-time-error-checking-options"></a>
<a name="index-profiling-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-program-instrumentation"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-run-time-error-checking"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-profiling"></a>

<p>GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates.  
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking 
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking.
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-prof"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-p</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-p"></a>
<p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>prof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
</p>
<a name="index-gprof"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pg</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pg"></a>
<p>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <code>gprof</code>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-arcs"></a>
<p>Add code so that program flow <em>arcs</em> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  On targets that support
constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used
as a type of a global variable.
</p>
<p>When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<samp><var>auxname</var>.gcda</samp> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>), or for
test coverage analysis (<samp>-ftest-coverage</samp>).  Each object file&rsquo;s
<var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <samp>foo.gcda</samp> for input file <samp>dir/foo.c</samp>, or
<samp>dir/foo.gcda</samp> for output file specified as <samp>-o dir/foo.o</samp>).
See <a href="Cross-profiling.html#Cross-profiling">Cross-profiling</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-gcov"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>--coverage</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-coverage"></a>

<p>This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>
<samp>-ftest-coverage</samp> (when compiling) and <samp>-lgcov</samp> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Compile the source files with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <samp>-ftest-coverage</samp> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.

</li><li> Compile the source files additionally with <samp>-fprofile-abs-path</samp>
to create absolute path names in the <samp>.gcno</samp> files.  This allows
<code>gcov</code> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
occur with different working directories.

</li><li> Link your object files with <samp>-lgcov</samp> or <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>
(the latter implies the former).

</li><li> Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless
a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, <code>fork</code> calls are
detected and correctly handled without double counting.

</li><li> For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp> (see <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Options that
Control Optimization</a>).

</li><li> For test coverage analysis, use <code>gcov</code> to produce human readable
information from the <samp>.gcno</samp> and <samp>.gcda</samp> files.  Refer to the
<code>gcov</code> documentation for further information.

</li></ul>

<p>With <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftest-coverage"></a>
<p>Produce a notes file that the <code>gcov</code> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="Gcov.html#Gcov"><code>gcov</code>&mdash;a Test Coverage Program</a>) can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file&rsquo;s note file is called
<samp><var>auxname</var>.gcno</samp>.  Refer to the <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp> option
above for a description of <var>auxname</var> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source files
more closely if you do not optimize.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-abs-path</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-abs-path"></a>
<p>Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names
in the <samp>.gcno</samp> files.  This allows <code>gcov</code> to find the correct
sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
directories.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-dir=<var>path</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-dir"></a>

<p>Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <var>path</var>.
This option affects only the profile data generated by
<samp>-fprofile-generate</samp>, <samp>-ftest-coverage</samp>, <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>
and used by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.
By default, GCC uses the current directory as <var>path</var>, thus the
profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-generate</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fprofile-generate=<var>path</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-generate"></a>

<p>Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization.  You must use <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> both when
compiling and when linking your program.
</p>
<p>The following options are enabled: <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>, <samp>-fprofile-values</samp>, <samp>-fvpt</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <var>path</var> is specified, GCC looks at the <var>path</var> to find
the profile feedback data files. See <samp>-fprofile-dir</samp>.
</p>
<p>To optimize the program based on the collected profile information, use
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.  See <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-update=<var>method</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-update"></a>

<p>Alter the update method for an application instrumented for profile
feedback based optimization.  The <var>method</var> argument should be one of
&lsquo;<samp>single</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>atomic</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>prefer-atomic</samp>&rsquo;.
The first one is useful for single-threaded applications,
while the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-safe code.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> When an application does not properly join all threads
(or creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.
</p>
<p>Using &lsquo;<samp>prefer-atomic</samp>&rsquo; would be transformed either to &lsquo;<samp>atomic</samp>&rsquo;,
when supported by a target, or to &lsquo;<samp>single</samp>&rsquo; otherwise.  The GCC driver
automatically selects &lsquo;<samp>prefer-atomic</samp>&rsquo; when <samp>-pthread</samp>
is present in the command line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=address</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003daddress"></a>
<p>Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.
The option enables <samp>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</samp>.
See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer</a> for
more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<code>ASAN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable.  When set to <code>help=1</code>,
the available options are shown at startup of the instrumented program.  See
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags</a>
for a list of supported options.
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fsanitize=thread</samp>
and/or <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=kernel-address</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dkernel-address"></a>
<p>Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.

<samp>-fsanitize=address</samp>
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fsanitize=thread</samp>
and/or <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
Note: By default the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it,
add <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1</code> to the environment variable
<code>ASAN_OPTIONS</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-subtract</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer-subtract"></a>
<p>Instrument subtraction with pointer operands.
The option must be combined with either <samp>-fsanitize=kernel-address</samp> or
<samp>-fsanitize=address</samp>
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fsanitize=thread</samp>
and/or <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
Note: By default the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it,
add <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1</code> to the environment variable
<code>ASAN_OPTIONS</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=thread</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dthread"></a>
<p>Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
data race bugs.  See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer</a> for more
details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <code>TSAN_OPTIONS</code>
environment variable; see
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags</a> for a list of
supported options.
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fsanitize=address</samp>,
<samp>-fsanitize=leak</samp> and/or <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
</p>
<p>Note that sanitized atomic builtins cannot throw exceptions when
operating on invalid memory addresses with non-call exceptions
(<samp>-fnon-call-exceptions</samp>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=leak</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dleak"></a>
<p>Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.
This option only matters for linking of executables and
the executable is linked against a library that overrides <code>malloc</code>
and other allocator functions.  See
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer</a> for more
details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<code>LSAN_OPTIONS</code> environment variable.
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fsanitize=thread</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=undefined</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dundefined"></a>
<p>Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector.
Various computations are instrumented to detect undefined behavior
at runtime.  Current suboptions are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fsanitize=shift</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift"></a>
<p>This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.
This option has two suboptions, <samp>-fsanitize=shift-base</samp> and
<samp>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift-exponent"></a>
<p>This option enables checking that the second argument of a shift operation
is not negative and is smaller than the precision of the promoted first
argument.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=shift-base</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift-base"></a>
<p>If the second argument of a shift operation is within range, check that the
result of a shift operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly is
considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as between
ISO C90 and C99, etc.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dinteger-divide-by-zero"></a>
<p>Detect integer division by zero as well as <code>INT_MIN / -1</code> division.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=unreachable</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dunreachable"></a>
<p>With this option, the compiler turns the <code>__builtin_unreachable</code>
call into a diagnostics message call instead.  When reaching the
<code>__builtin_unreachable</code> call, the behavior is undefined.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=vla-bound</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dvla-bound"></a>
<p>This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable
length array is positive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=null</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dnull"></a>
<p>This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the application
built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it
tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or if a reference (possibly an
rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked
on an object pointed by a NULL pointer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=return</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dreturn"></a>
<p>This option enables return statement checking.  Programs
built with this option turned on will issue an error message
when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually
returning a value.  This option works in C++ only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dsigned-integer-overflow"></a>
<p>This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We check that
the result of <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, and both unary and binary <code>-</code>
does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note, integer promotion
rules must be taken into account.  That is, the following is not an
overflow:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
a++;
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=bounds</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbounds"></a>
<p>This option enables instrumentation of array bounds.  Various out of bounds
accesses are detected.  Flexible array members, flexible array member-like
arrays, and initializers of variables with static storage are not instrumented.
The option cannot be combined with <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbounds-strict"></a>
<p>This option enables strict instrumentation of array bounds.  Most out of bounds
accesses are detected, including flexible array members and flexible array
member-like arrays.  Initializers of variables with static storage are not
instrumented.  The option cannot be combined
with <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=alignment</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dalignment"></a>

<p>This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when they are
dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to insufficiently aligned target,
or when a method or constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=object-size</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dobject-size"></a>
<p>This option enables instrumentation of memory references using the
<code>__builtin_object_size</code> function.  Various out of bounds pointer
accesses are detected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dfloat-divide-by-zero"></a>
<p>Detect floating-point division by zero.  Unlike other similar options,
<samp>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</samp> is not enabled by
<samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp>, since floating-point division by zero can
be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dfloat-cast-overflow"></a>
<p>This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking.
We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow.
Unlike other similar options, <samp>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</samp> is
not enabled by <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp>.
This option does not work well with <code>FE_INVALID</code> exceptions enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dnonnull-attribute"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values
are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the
<code>nonnull</code> function attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dreturns-nonnull-attribute"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions
marked with <code>returns_nonnull</code> function attribute, to detect returning
of null values from such functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=bool</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbool"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other
than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=enum</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003denum"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If
a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded,
a run-time error is issued.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=vptr</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dvptr"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function calls, member
accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes,
to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer-overflow"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of pointer arithmetics.  If the pointer
arithmetics overflows, a run-time error is issued.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=builtin</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbuiltin"></a>

<p>This option enables instrumentation of arguments to selected builtin
functions.  If an invalid value is passed to such arguments, a run-time
error is issued.  E.g.&nbsp;passing 0 as the argument to <code>__builtin_ctz</code>
or <code>__builtin_clz</code> invokes undefined behavior and is diagnosed
by this option.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>While <samp>-ftrapv</samp> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
<samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp> gives a diagnostic message.
This currently works only for the C family of languages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-sanitize=all</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-sanitize_003dall"></a>

<p>This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.
<samp>-fsanitize=all</samp> is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be used
together.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fasan-shadow-offset=<var>number</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fasan-shadow-offset"></a>
<p>This option forces GCC to use custom shadow offset in AddressSanitizer checks.
It is useful for experimenting with different shadow memory layouts in
Kernel AddressSanitizer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize-sections=<var>s1</var>,<var>s2</var>,...</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize-sections"></a>
<p>Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.  <var>si</var> may
contain wildcards.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsanitize-recover<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>opts</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsanitize-recover"></a>
<a name="index-fno-sanitize-recover"></a>
<p><samp>-fsanitize-recover=</samp> controls error recovery mode for sanitizers
mentioned in comma-separated list of <var>opts</var>.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The <samp>-fno-sanitize-recover=</samp> option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.
</p>
<p>Currently this feature only works for <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp> (and its suboptions
except for <samp>-fsanitize=unreachable</samp> and <samp>-fsanitize=return</samp>),
<samp>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</samp>, <samp>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</samp>,

For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default,
except <samp>-fsanitize=address</samp>, for which this feature is experimental.
<samp>-fsanitize-recover=all</samp> and <samp>-fno-sanitize-recover=all</samp> is also
accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that support it,
the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.
</p>
<p>Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also
enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still fatal.
The runtime library defaults to <code>halt_on_error=0</code> for
ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is <code>halt_on_error=1</code>. This can be overridden through
setting the <code>halt_on_error</code> flag in the corresponding environment variable.

<p>Enable Pointer Bounds Checker instrumentation.  Each memory reference
is instrumented with checks of the pointer used for memory access against
bounds associated with that pointer.  
</p>
<p>Currently there
is only an implementation for Intel MPX available, thus x86 GNU/Linux target
and <samp>-mmpx</samp> are required to enable this feature.  
MPX-based instrumentation requires
a runtime library to enable MPX in hardware and handle bounds
violation signals.  By default when <samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp>
and <samp>-mmpx</samp> options are used to link a program, the GCC driver
links against the <samp>libmpx</samp> and <samp>libmpxwrappers</samp> libraries.
Bounds checking on calls to dynamic libraries requires a linker
with <samp>-z bndplt</samp> support; if GCC was configured with a linker
without support for this option (including the Gold linker and older
versions of ld), a warning is given if you link with <samp>-mmpx</samp>
without also specifying <samp>-static</samp>, since the overall effectiveness
of the bounds checking protection is reduced.
See also <samp>-static-libmpxwrappers</samp>.
</p>
<p>MPX-based instrumentation
may be used for debugging and also may be included in production code
to increase program security.  Depending on usage, you may
have different requirements for the runtime library.  The current version
of the MPX runtime library is more oriented for use as a debugging
tool.  MPX runtime library usage implies <samp>-lpthread</samp>.  See
also <samp>-static-libmpx</samp>.  The runtime library  behavior can be
influenced using various <code>CHKP_RT_*</code> environment variables.  See
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Intel%20MPX%20support%20in%20the%20GCC%20compiler</a>
for more details.

<p>Generated instrumentation may be controlled by various
<samp>-fchkp-*</samp> options and by the <code>bnd_variable_size</code>
structure field attribute (see <a href="Type-Attributes.html#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>) and
<code>bnd_legacy</code>, and <code>bnd_instrument</code> function attributes
(see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).  GCC also provides a number of built-in

<dd><a name="index-fcf-protection"></a>
<p>Enable code instrumentation of control-flow transfers to increase
program security by checking that target addresses of control-flow
transfer instructions (such as indirect function call, function return,
indirect jump) are valid.  This prevents diverting the flow of control
to an unexpected target.  This is intended to protect against such
threats as Return-oriented Programming (ROP), and similarly
call/jmp-oriented programming (COP/JOP).
</p>
<p>The value <code>branch</code> tells the compiler to implement checking of
validity of control-flow transfer at the point of indirect branch
instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value <code>return</code>
implements checking of validity at the point of returning from a
function.  The value <code>full</code> is an alias for specifying both
<code>branch</code> and <code>return</code>. The value <code>none</code> turns off
instrumentation.
</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>nocf_check</code> attribute to identify
which functions and calls should be skipped from instrumentation
(see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p>Currently the x86 GNU/Linux target provides an implementation based
on Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).  Instrumentation
for x86 is controlled by target-specific options <samp>-mcet</samp>,

<dt><code>-fstack-check</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack-check"></a>
<p>Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
</p>
<p>Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
</p>
<p>You can additionally specify a string parameter: &lsquo;<samp>no</samp>&rsquo; means no
checking, &lsquo;<samp>generic</samp>&rsquo; means force the use of old-style checking,
&lsquo;<samp>specific</samp>&rsquo; means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare <samp>-fstack-check</samp>.
</p>
<p>Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.  Note this
may change the semantics of some code.

</li><li> Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.

</li><li> Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
</li></ol>

<p>Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
&lsquo;<samp>specific</samp>&rsquo; if no target support has been added in the compiler.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp>-fstack-check=</samp>&rsquo; is designed for Ada&rsquo;s needs to detect infinite recursion
and stack overflows.  &lsquo;<samp>specific</samp>&rsquo; is an excellent choice when compiling
Ada code.  It is not generally sufficient to protect against stack-clash
attacks.  To protect against those you want &lsquo;<samp>-fstack-clash-protection</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstack-clash-protection</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack-clash-protection"></a>
<p>Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When this option is
enabled, the compiler will only allocate one page of stack space at a time
and each page is accessed immediately after allocation.  Thus, it prevents
allocations from jumping over any stack guard page provided by the
operating system.
</p>
<p>Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection.  However, on
those targets <samp>-fstack-clash-protection</samp> will protect dynamic stack
allocations.  <samp>-fstack-clash-protection</samp> may also provide limited
protection for static stack allocations if the target supports
<samp>-fstack-check=specific</samp>.

<a name="index-fno-stack-limit"></a>
<p>Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
</p>
<p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address &lsquo;<samp>0x80000000</samp>&rsquo;
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<samp>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</samp> and
<samp>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</samp> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.
</p>
<p>You can locally override stack limit checking by using the
<code>no_stack_limit</code> function attribute (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsplit-stack</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsplit-stack"></a>
<p>Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.
</p>
<p>When code compiled with <samp>-fsplit-stack</samp> calls code compiled
without <samp>-fsplit-stack</samp>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with <samp>-fsplit-stack</samp> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without <samp>-fsplit-stack</samp> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.

<p>This option is only available when compiling C++ code.
It turns on (or off, if using <samp>-fvtable-verify=none</samp>) the security
feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.
</p>
<p>This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup,
which are used for verifying the vtable pointers.  
The options &lsquo;<samp>std</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>preinit</samp>&rsquo;
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches <code>main</code>.  Using
<samp>-fvtable-verify=std</samp> causes the data structures to be built after
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.
<samp>-fvtable-verify=preinit</samp> causes them to be built before shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.
</p>
<p>If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different
values specified, &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo; takes highest priority over both &lsquo;<samp>std</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>preinit</samp>&rsquo;; &lsquo;<samp>preinit</samp>&rsquo; takes priority over &lsquo;<samp>std</samp>&rsquo;.

that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit.
The compiler writes this information to a file named
<samp>vtv_count_data.log</samp> in the directory named by the environment

<dt><code>-finstrument-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finstrument-functions"></a>
<p>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<code>__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
</pre></div>

<p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
</p>
<p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <code>extern inline</code> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
</p>
<p>A function may be given the attribute <code>no_instrument_function</code>, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

<p>This is similar to <samp>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</samp>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <code>vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)</code>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <code>_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</code>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <var>sym</var> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpatchable-function-entry=<var>N</var>[,<var>M</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpatchable-function-entry"></a>
<p>Generate <var>N</var> NOPs right at the beginning
of each function, with the function entry point before the <var>M</var>th NOP.
If <var>M</var> is omitted, it defaults to <code>0</code> so the
function entry points to the address just at the first NOP.
The NOP instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in
any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly via
the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the instruction
emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface <code>gen_nop</code>.  This behavior
is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
other compilation options.
</p>
<p>For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas,
which correspond to their respective function entries minus <var>M</var>,
are additionally collected in the <code>__patchable_function_entries</code>
section of the resulting binary.
</p>
<p>Note that the value of <code>__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))</code> takes precedence over command-line option
<samp>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</samp>.  This can be used to increase
the area size or to remove it completely on a single function.
If <code>N=0</code>, no pad location is recorded.
</p>
<p>The NOP instructions are inserted at&mdash;and maybe before, depending on
<var>M</var>&mdash;the function entry address, even before the prologue.

<h3 class="section">3.12 Options Controlling the Preprocessor</h3>
<a name="index-preprocessor-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-preprocessor"></a>

<p>These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
</p>
<p>If you use the <samp>-E</samp> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <samp>-E</samp> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
</p>
<p>In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options 
to control search paths for include files documented in 
<a href="Directory-Options.html#Directory-Options">Directory Options</a>.  
Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in 
<a href="Warning-Options.html#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-D <var>name</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-D"></a>
<p>Predefine <var>name</var> as a macro, with definition <code>1</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-D <var>name</var>=<var>definition</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The contents of <var>definition</var> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a &lsquo;<samp>#define</samp>&rsquo;
directive.  In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters.
</p>
<p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell&rsquo;s quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
</p>
<p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should
quote the option.  With <code>sh</code> and <code>csh</code>,
<samp>-D'<var>name</var>(<var>args&hellip;</var>)=<var>definition</var>'</samp> works.
</p>
<p><samp>-D</samp> and <samp>-U</samp> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <samp>-imacros <var>file</var></samp> and
<samp>-include <var>file</var></samp> options are processed after all
<samp>-D</samp> and <samp>-U</samp> options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-U <var>name</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-U"></a>
<p>Cancel any previous definition of <var>name</var>, either built in or
provided with a <samp>-D</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-include <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-include"></a>
<p>Process <var>file</var> as if <code>#include &quot;file&quot;</code> appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for <var>file</var> is the preprocessor&rsquo;s working directory <em>instead of</em>
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the <code>#include &quot;&hellip;&quot;</code> search
chain as normal.
</p>
<p>If multiple <samp>-include</samp> options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-imacros <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-imacros"></a>
<p>Exactly like <samp>-include</samp>, except that any output produced by
scanning <var>file</var> is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.
</p>
<p>All files specified by <samp>-imacros</samp> are processed before all files
specified by <samp>-include</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-undef</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-undef"></a>
<p>Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pthread</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pthread"></a>
<p>Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads library.
You should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking.
This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,
and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-M</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-M"></a>
<a name="index-make"></a>
<a name="index-dependencies_002c-make"></a>
<p>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <code>make</code> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <code>make</code> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <samp>-include</samp> or
<samp>-imacros</samp> command-line options.
</p>
<p>Unless specified explicitly (with <samp>-MT</samp> or <samp>-MQ</samp>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
</p>
<p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor&rsquo;s debug output, such as
<samp>-dM</samp>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<samp>-MF</samp>, or use an environment variable like
<code>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</code> (see <a href="Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>).  Debug output
is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.
</p>
<p>Passing <samp>-M</samp> to the driver implies <samp>-E</samp>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <samp>-w</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-MM</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MM"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-M</samp> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
</p>
<p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
&lsquo;<samp>#include</samp>&rsquo; directive does not in itself determine whether that
header appears in <samp>-MM</samp> dependency output.
</p>
<a name="dashMF"></a></dd>
<dt><code>-MF <var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MF"></a>
<p>When used with <samp>-M</samp> or <samp>-MM</samp>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <samp>-MF</samp> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send
preprocessed output.
</p>
<p>When used with the driver options <samp>-MD</samp> or <samp>-MMD</samp>,
<samp>-MF</samp> overrides the default dependency output file.
</p>
<p>If <var>file</var> is <samp>-</samp>, then the dependencies are written to <samp>stdout</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-MG</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MG"></a>
<p>In conjunction with an option such as <samp>-M</samp> requesting
dependency generation, <samp>-MG</samp> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code>#include</code> directive without prepending any path.  <samp>-MG</samp>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
</p>
<p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-MP</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MP"></a>
<p>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <code>make</code> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <samp>Makefile</samp> to match.
</p>
<p>This is typical output:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-MT <var>target</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MT"></a>

<p>Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as &lsquo;<samp>.c</samp>&rsquo;, and
appends the platform&rsquo;s usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
</p>
<p>An <samp>-MT</samp> option sets the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <samp>-MT</samp>, or use multiple <samp>-MT</samp> options.
</p>
<p>For example, <samp><span class="nolinebreak">-MT</span>&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></samp> might give
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-MQ <var>target</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MQ"></a>

<p>Same as <samp>-MT</samp>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <samp><span class="nolinebreak">-MQ</span>&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></samp> gives
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
</pre></div>

<p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<samp>-MQ</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-MD</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MD"></a>
<p><samp>-MD</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-M -MF <var>file</var></samp>, except that
<samp>-E</samp> is not implied.  The driver determines <var>file</var> based on
whether an <samp>-o</samp> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <samp>.d</samp>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a <samp>.d</samp> suffix.
</p>
<p>If <samp>-MD</samp> is used in conjunction with <samp>-E</samp>, any
<samp>-o</samp> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(see <a href="#dashMF">-MF</a>), but if used without <samp>-E</samp>, each <samp>-o</samp>
is understood to specify a target object file.
</p>
<p>Since <samp>-E</samp> is not implied, <samp>-MD</samp> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-MMD</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MMD"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-MD</samp> except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpreprocessed</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpreprocessed"></a>
<p>Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <samp>-C</samp> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
</p>
<p><samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions &lsquo;<samp>.i</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>.ii</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>.mi</samp>&rsquo;.  These are the
extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
<samp>-save-temps</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdirectives-only</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdirectives-only"></a>
<p>When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
</p>
<p>The option&rsquo;s behavior depends on the <samp>-E</samp> and <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp>
options.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-E</samp>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as <code>#define</code>, <code>#ifdef</code>, and <code>#error</code>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <samp>-dD</samp> option is
implicitly enabled.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as <code>__LINE__</code>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>.
</p>
<p>With both <samp>-E</samp> and <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp>, the rules for
<samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with <code>-E -fdirectives-only</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdollars-in-identifiers"></a>
<a name="fdollars-in-identifiers"></a><p>Accept &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; in identifiers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fextended-identifiers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fextended-identifiers"></a>
<p>Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-canonical-system-headers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-canonical-system-headers"></a>
<p>When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftabstop=<var>width</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftabstop"></a>
<p>Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftrack-macro-expansion<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>level</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftrack-macro-expansion"></a>
<p>Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <var>level</var> parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value &lsquo;<samp>0</samp>&rsquo; of <var>level</var> de-activates
this option. Value &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo; tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value &lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo; tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
&lsquo;<samp>2</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>-ftrack-macro-expansion=2</code> is activated by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmacro-prefix-map=<var>old</var>=<var>new</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmacro-prefix-map"></a>
<p>When preprocessing files residing in directory <samp><var>old</var></samp>,
expand the <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__BASE_FILE__</code> macros as if the
files resided in directory <samp><var>new</var></samp> instead.  This can be used
to change an absolute path to a relative path by using <samp>.</samp> for
<var>new</var> which can result in more reproducible builds that are
location independent.  This option also affects
<code>__builtin_FILE()</code> during compilation.  See also
<samp>-ffile-prefix-map</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fexec-charset=<var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fexec-charset"></a>
<a name="index-character-set_002c-execution"></a>
<p>Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is UTF-8.  <var>charset</var> can be any encoding
supported by the system&rsquo;s <code>iconv</code> library routine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fwide-exec-charset=<var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fwide-exec-charset"></a>
<a name="index-character-set_002c-wide-execution"></a>
<p>Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
corresponds to the width of <code>wchar_t</code>.  As with
<samp>-fexec-charset</samp>, <var>charset</var> can be any encoding supported
by the system&rsquo;s <code>iconv</code> library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in <code>wchar_t</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finput-charset=<var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finput-charset"></a>
<a name="index-character-set_002c-input"></a>
<p>Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by GCC.  If the
locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command-line option.  Currently the command-line option takes
precedence if there&rsquo;s a conflict.  <var>charset</var> can be any encoding
supported by the system&rsquo;s <code>iconv</code> library routine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpch-deps</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpch-deps"></a>
<p>When using precompiled headers (see <a href="Precompiled-Headers.html#Precompiled-Headers">Precompiled Headers</a>), this flag
causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header&rsquo;s dependencies.  If not specified, only the
precompiled header are listed and not the files that were used to
create it, because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpch-preprocess</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpch-preprocess"></a>
<p>This option allows use of a precompiled header (see <a href="Precompiled-Headers.html#Precompiled-Headers">Precompiled Headers</a>) together with <samp>-E</samp>.  It inserts a special <code>#pragma</code>,
<code>#pragma GCC pch_preprocess &quot;<var>filename</var>&quot;</code> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <var>filename</var>.
When <samp>-fpreprocessed</samp> is in use, GCC recognizes this <code>#pragma</code>
and loads the PCH.
</p>
<p>This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by
<samp>-save-temps</samp>.
</p>
<p>You should not write this <code>#pragma</code> in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to GCC&rsquo;s
current directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fworking-directory</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fworking-directory"></a>
<a name="index-fno-working-directory"></a>
<p>Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC uses this
directory, when it&rsquo;s present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <samp>-fno-working-directory</samp>.  If the <samp>-P</samp> flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
<code>#line</code> directives are emitted whatsoever.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-A <var>predicate</var>=<var>answer</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-A"></a>
<p>Make an assertion with the predicate <var>predicate</var> and answer
<var>answer</var>.  This form is preferred to the older form <samp>-A
<var>predicate</var>(<var>answer</var>)</samp>, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-A -<var>predicate</var>=<var>answer</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Cancel an assertion with the predicate <var>predicate</var> and answer
<var>answer</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-C</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-C"></a>
<p>Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
</p>
<p>You should be prepared for side effects when using <samp>-C</samp>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-CC</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-CC"></a>
<p>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like <samp>-C</samp>, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>In addition to the side-effects of the <samp>-C</samp> option, the
<samp>-CC</samp> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.
</p>
<p>The <samp>-CC</samp> option is generally used to support lint comments.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-P</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-P"></a>
<p>Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.
</p>
<a name="index-traditional-C-language"></a>
<a name="index-C-language_002c-traditional"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-traditional</code></dt>
<dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-traditional-cpp"></a>
<a name="index-traditional"></a>

<p>Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as
opposed to ISO C preprocessors.
See the GNU CPP manual for details.
</p>
<p>Note that GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard 
C compiler, and these options are only supported with the <samp>-E</samp> 
switch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-trigraphs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-trigraphs"></a>
<p>Support ISO C trigraphs.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with &lsquo;<samp>??</samp>&rsquo;, that
are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  For example,
&lsquo;<samp>??/</samp>&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;<samp>\</samp>&rsquo;, so &lsquo;<samp>'??/n'</samp>&rsquo; is a character
constant for a newline.
</p>
<p>The nine trigraphs and their replacements are
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~
</pre></div>

<p>By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the <samp>-std</samp> and
<samp>-ansi</samp> options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-remap</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-remap"></a>
<p>Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very
short file names, such as MS-DOS.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-H</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-H"></a>
<p>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
&lsquo;<samp>#include</samp>&rsquo; stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled
header file is printed with &lsquo;<samp>...x</samp>&rsquo; and a valid one with &lsquo;<samp>...!</samp>&rsquo; .
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-d<var>letters</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-d"></a>
<p>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified by
<var>letters</var>.  The flags documented here are those relevant to the
preprocessor.  Other <var>letters</var> are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify <var>letters</var> whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.
See <a href="Developer-Options.html#Developer-Options">Developer Options</a>, for more information.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-dM</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dM"></a>
<p>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of &lsquo;<samp>#define</samp>&rsquo;
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <samp>foo.h</samp>, the command
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
</pre></div>

<p>shows all the predefined macros.
</p>
<p>If you use <samp>-dM</samp> without the <samp>-E</samp> option, <samp>-dM</samp> is
interpreted as a synonym for <samp>-fdump-rtl-mach</samp>.
See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Developer-Options.html#Developer-Options">(gcc)Developer Options</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dD</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dD"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-dM</samp> except in two respects: it does <em>not</em> include the
predefined macros, and it outputs <em>both</em> the &lsquo;<samp>#define</samp>&rsquo;
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dN</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dN"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-dD</samp>, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dI</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dI"></a>
<p>Output &lsquo;<samp>#include</samp>&rsquo; directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dU</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dU"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-dD</samp> except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
&lsquo;<samp>#undef</samp>&rsquo; directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fdebug-cpp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdebug-cpp"></a>
<p>This option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used from CPP or with
<samp>-E</samp>, it dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location
belongs to.
</p>
<p>When used from GCC without <samp>-E</samp>, this option has no effect.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wp,<var>option</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wp"></a>
<p>You can use <samp>-Wp,<var>option</var></samp> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <var>option</var> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<var>option</var> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<samp>-Wp</samp> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor&rsquo;s direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <samp>-Wp</samp> and let the driver handle the
options instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Xpreprocessor <var>option</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Xpreprocessor"></a>
<p>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not 
recognize.
</p>
<p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<samp>-Xpreprocessor</samp> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-no-integrated-cpp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-no-integrated-cpp"></a>
<p>Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(<code>cc1</code>, <code>cc1plus</code>, or <code>cc1obj</code> for C, C++,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the <samp>-B</samp> or
<samp>-wrapper</samp> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.

<a name="Options-for-Linking"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.14 Options for Linking</h3>
<a name="index-link-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-linking"></a>

<p>These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-file-names"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>object-file-name</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-c</code></dt>
<dt><code>-S</code></dt>
<dt><code>-E</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-c-1"></a>
<a name="index-S-1"></a>
<a name="index-E-1"></a>
<p>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  See <a href="Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fuse-ld=bfd</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fuse-ld_003dbfd"></a>
<p>Use the <code>bfd</code> linker instead of the default linker.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fuse-ld=gold</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fuse-ld_003dgold"></a>
<p>Use the <code>gold</code> linker instead of the default linker.
</p>
<a name="index-Libraries"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-l<var>library</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-l <var>library</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-l"></a>
<p>Search the library named <var>library</var> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)
</p>
<p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, &lsquo;<samp>foo.o -lz bar.o</samp>&rsquo; searches library &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;
after file <samp>foo.o</samp> but before <samp>bar.o</samp>.  If <samp>bar.o</samp> refers
to functions in &lsquo;<samp>z</samp>&rsquo;, those functions may not be loaded.
</p>
<p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <samp>lib<var>library</var>.a</samp>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.
</p>
<p>The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <samp>-L</samp>.
</p>
<p>Normally the files found this way are library files&mdash;archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <samp>-l</samp> option and specifying a file name
is that <samp>-l</samp> surrounds <var>library</var> with &lsquo;<samp>lib</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>.a</samp>&rsquo;
and searches several directories.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-lobjc</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-lobjc"></a>
<p>You need this special case of the <samp>-l</samp> option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nostartfiles</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nostartfiles"></a>
<p>Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless <samp>-nostdlib</samp>
or <samp>-nodefaultlibs</samp> is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nodefaultlibs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nodefaultlibs"></a>
<p>Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as <samp>-static-libgcc</samp>
or <samp>-shared-libgcc</samp>, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <samp>-nostartfiles</samp>
is used.  
</p>
<p>The compiler may generate calls to <code>memcmp</code>,
<code>memset</code>, <code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nostdlib</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nostdlib"></a>
<p>Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
<samp>-static-libgcc</samp> or <samp>-shared-libgcc</samp>, are ignored.
</p>
<p>The compiler may generate calls to <code>memcmp</code>, <code>memset</code>,
<code>memcpy</code> and <code>memmove</code>.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

<a name="index-unresolved-references-and--nostdlib"></a>

<a name="index--nodefaultlibs-and-unresolved-references"></a>
<a name="index-unresolved-references-and--nodefaultlibs"></a>
<p>One of the standard libraries bypassed by <samp>-nostdlib</samp> and
<samp>-nodefaultlibs</samp> is <samp>libgcc.a</samp>, a library of internal subroutines
which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
(See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Interface.html#Interface">Interfacing to GCC Output</a> in <cite>GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC) Internals</cite>,
for more discussion of <samp>libgcc.a</samp>.)
In most cases, you need <samp>libgcc.a</samp> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <samp>-nostdlib</samp>
or <samp>-nodefaultlibs</samp> you should usually specify <samp>-lgcc</samp> as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is <code>__main</code>, used to ensure C++
constructors are called; see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Collect2.html#Collect2"><code>collect2</code></a> in <cite>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</cite>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pie</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pie"></a>
<p>Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable on targets
that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
set of options used for compilation (<samp>-fpie</samp>, <samp>-fPIE</samp>,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-no-pie</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-no-pie"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-pie</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-pie"></a>
<p>Produce a static position independent executable on targets that support
it.  A static position independent executable is similar to a static
executable, but can be loaded at any address without a dynamic linker.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (<samp>-fpie</samp>, <samp>-fPIE</samp>, or model
suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pthread</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pthread-1"></a>
<p>Link with the POSIX threads library.  This option is supported on 
GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on 
x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets this option also sets 
flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both
compilation and linking.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-rdynamic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-rdynamic"></a>
<p>Pass the flag <samp>-export-dynamic</samp> to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of <code>dlopen</code> or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-s</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-s"></a>
<p>Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static"></a>
<p>On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides <samp>-pie</samp>
and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this
option has no effect.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-shared</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-shared"></a>
<p>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(<samp>-fpic</samp>, <samp>-fPIC</samp>, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-shared-libgcc</code></dt>
<dt><code>-static-libgcc</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-shared-libgcc"></a>
<a name="index-static-libgcc"></a>
<p>On systems that provide <samp>libgcc</samp> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of <samp>libgcc</samp> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
</p>
<p>There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <samp>libgcc</samp> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <samp>libgcc</samp>.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the G++ and driver automatically adds <samp>-shared-libgcc</samp>
 whenever you build a shared library or a main executable, because C++
 programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.
</p>
<p>If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared <samp>libgcc</samp>.
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option <samp>--eh-frame-hdr</samp>,
it links the shared version of <samp>libgcc</samp> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of <samp>libgcc</samp>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
</p>
<p>However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
<samp>-shared-libgcc</samp>, such that it is linked with the shared
<samp>libgcc</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libasan</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libasan"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fsanitize=address</samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp>libasan</samp>.  If
<samp>libasan</samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp>-static</samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp>libasan</samp>.  The <samp>-static-libasan</samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp>libasan</samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libtsan</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libtsan"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fsanitize=thread</samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp>libtsan</samp>.  If
<samp>libtsan</samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp>-static</samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp>libtsan</samp>.  The <samp>-static-libtsan</samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp>libtsan</samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-liblsan</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-liblsan"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fsanitize=leak</samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp>liblsan</samp>.  If
<samp>liblsan</samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp>-static</samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp>liblsan</samp>.  The <samp>-static-liblsan</samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp>liblsan</samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libubsan</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libubsan"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fsanitize=undefined</samp> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <samp>libubsan</samp>.  If
<samp>libubsan</samp> is available as a shared library, and the <samp>-static</samp>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<samp>libubsan</samp>.  The <samp>-static-libubsan</samp> option directs the GCC
driver to link <samp>libubsan</samp> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libmpx</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libmpx"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fcheck-pointer bounds</samp> and <samp>-mmpx</samp> options are
used to link a program, the GCC driver automatically links against
<samp>libmpx</samp>.  If <samp>libmpx</samp> is available as a shared library,
and the <samp>-static</samp> option is not used, then this links against
the shared version of <samp>libmpx</samp>.  The <samp>-static-libmpx</samp>
option directs the GCC driver to link <samp>libmpx</samp> statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libmpxwrappers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libmpxwrappers"></a>
<p>When the <samp>-fcheck-pointer bounds</samp> and <samp>-mmpx</samp> options are used
to link a program without also using <samp>-fno-chkp-use-wrappers</samp>, the
GCC driver automatically links against <samp>libmpxwrappers</samp>.  If
<samp>libmpxwrappers</samp> is available as a shared library, and the
<samp>-static</samp> option is not used, then this links against the shared
version of <samp>libmpxwrappers</samp>.  The <samp>-static-libmpxwrappers</samp>
option directs the GCC driver to link <samp>libmpxwrappers</samp> statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-static-libstdc++</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-static-libstdc_002b_002b"></a>
<p>When the <code>g++</code> program is used to link a C++ program, it
normally automatically links against <samp>libstdc++</samp>.  If
<samp>libstdc++</samp> is available as a shared library, and the
<samp>-static</samp> option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of <samp>libstdc++</samp>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of <samp>libstdc++</samp> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
<samp>-static-libstdc++</samp> option directs the <code>g++</code> driver to
link <samp>libstdc++</samp> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-symbolic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-symbolic"></a>
<p>Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option <samp>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs</samp>).  Only a few systems support
this option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-T <var>script</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-T"></a>
<a name="index-linker-script"></a>
<p>Use <var>script</var> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the <samp>-T</samp> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Xlinker <var>option</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Xlinker"></a>
<p>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.
</p>
<p>If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
<samp>-Xlinker</samp> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <samp>-assert definitions</samp>, you must write
<samp>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</samp>.  It does not work to write
<samp>-Xlinker &quot;-assert definitions&quot;</samp>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
</p>
<p>When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <samp><var>option</var>=<var>value</var></samp>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
<samp>-Xlinker -Map=output.map</samp> rather than
<samp>-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</samp>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wl,<var>option</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wl"></a>
<p>Pass <var>option</var> as an option to the linker.  If <var>option</var> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, <samp>-Wl,-Map,output.map</samp> passes <samp>-Map output.map</samp> to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
<samp>-Wl,-Map=output.map</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-u <var>symbol</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-u"></a>
<p>Pretend the symbol <var>symbol</var> is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use <samp>-u</samp> multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-z <var>keyword</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-z"></a>
<p><samp>-z</samp> is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
<var>keyword</var>. See the section in the documentation of your linker for
permitted values and their meanings.

<p>On some systems, &lsquo;<samp>gcc -shared</samp>&rsquo;
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On

<a name="Options-for-Directory-Search"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.15 Options for Directory Search</h3>
<a name="index-directory-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-directory-search"></a>
<a name="index-search-path"></a>

<p>These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-I <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-iquote <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-isystem <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-idirafter <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-I"></a>
<a name="index-iquote"></a>
<a name="index-isystem"></a>
<a name="index-idirafter"></a>
<p>Add the directory <var>dir</var> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files during preprocessing.
If <var>dir</var> begins with &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; or <code>$SYSROOT</code>, then the &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo;
or <code>$SYSROOT</code> is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
<samp>--sysroot</samp> and <samp>-isysroot</samp>.
</p>
<p>Directories specified with <samp>-iquote</samp> apply only to the quote 
form of the directive, <code>#include&nbsp;&quot;<var>file</var>&quot;<!-- /@w --></code>.
Directories specified with <samp>-I</samp>, <samp>-isystem</samp>, 
or <samp>-idirafter</samp> apply to lookup for both the
<code>#include&nbsp;&quot;<var>file</var>&quot;<!-- /@w --></code> and
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;<var>file</var>&gt;<!-- /@w --></code> directives.
</p>
<p>You can specify any number or combination of these options on the 
command line to search for header files in several directories.  
The lookup order is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> For the quote form of the include directive, the directory of the current
file is searched first.

</li><li> For the quote form of the include directive, the directories specified
by <samp>-iquote</samp> options are searched in left-to-right order,
as they appear on the command line.

</li><li> Directories specified with <samp>-I</samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.

</li><li> Directories specified with <samp>-isystem</samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.

</li><li> Standard system directories are scanned.

</li><li> Directories specified with <samp>-idirafter</samp> options are scanned in
left-to-right order.
</li></ol>

<p>You can use <samp>-I</samp> to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the standard system header file directories.  
However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files; use <samp>-isystem</samp> for that.
</p>
<p>The <samp>-isystem</samp> and <samp>-idirafter</samp> options also mark the directory
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that
is applied to the standard system directories.
</p>
<p>If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<samp>-isystem</samp>, is also specified with <samp>-I</samp>, the <samp>-I</samp>
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC&rsquo;s procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the <code>#include_next</code> directive are not inadvertently
changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <samp>-nostdinc</samp> and/or <samp>-isystem</samp> options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-I-</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-I-"></a>
<p>Split the include path.
This option has been deprecated.  Please use <samp>-iquote</samp> instead for
<samp>-I</samp> directories before the <samp>-I-</samp> and remove the <samp>-I-</samp>
option.
</p>
<p>Any directories specified with <samp>-I</samp>
options before <samp>-I-</samp> are searched only for headers requested with
<code>#include&nbsp;&quot;<var>file</var>&quot;<!-- /@w --></code>; they are not searched for
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;<var>file</var>&gt;<!-- /@w --></code>.  If additional directories are
specified with <samp>-I</samp> options after the <samp>-I-</samp>, those
directories are searched for all &lsquo;<samp>#include</samp>&rsquo; directives.
</p>
<p>In addition, <samp>-I-</samp> inhibits the use of the directory of the current
file directory as the first search directory for <code>#include&nbsp;&quot;<var>file</var>&quot;<!-- /@w --></code>.  There is no way to override this effect of <samp>-I-</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-iprefix <var>prefix</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-iprefix"></a>
<p>Specify <var>prefix</var> as the prefix for subsequent <samp>-iwithprefix</samp>
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-iwithprefix <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-iwithprefixbefore <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-iwithprefix"></a>
<a name="index-iwithprefixbefore"></a>
<p>Append <var>dir</var> to the prefix specified previously with
<samp>-iprefix</samp>, and add the resulting directory to the include search
path.  <samp>-iwithprefixbefore</samp> puts it in the same place <samp>-I</samp>
would; <samp>-iwithprefix</samp> puts it where <samp>-idirafter</samp> would.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-isysroot <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-isysroot"></a>
<p>This option is like the <samp>--sysroot</samp> option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the <samp>--sysroot</samp> option for more
information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-imultilib <var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-imultilib"></a>
<p>Use <var>dir</var> as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nostdinc</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nostdinc"></a>
<p>Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories explicitly specified with <samp>-I</samp>,
<samp>-iquote</samp>, <samp>-isystem</samp>, and/or <samp>-idirafter</samp>
options (and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) 
are searched.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-nostdinc++</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-1"></a>
<p>Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard directories,
but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option is
used when building the C++ library.)
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>-iplugindir=<var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-iplugindir_003d"></a>
<p>Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by <samp>-fplugin=<var>name</var></samp> instead of
<samp>-fplugin=<var>path</var>/<var>name</var>.so</samp>.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-L<var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-L"></a>
<p>Add directory <var>dir</var> to the list of directories to be searched
for <samp>-l</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-B<var>prefix</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-B"></a>
<p>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
</p>
<p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<code>cpp</code>, <code>cc1</code>, <code>as</code> and <code>ld</code>.  It tries
<var>prefix</var> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without &lsquo;<samp><var>machine</var>/<var>version</var>/</samp>&rsquo; for the corresponding target
machine and compiler version.
</p>
<p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<samp>-B</samp> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <samp>-B</samp>
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
<samp>/usr/lib/gcc/</samp> and <samp>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</samp>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<code>PATH</code> environment variable.
</p>
<p>The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <samp>-B</samp>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
</p>
<p><samp>-B</samp> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <samp>-L</samp> options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <samp>-isystem</samp> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends &lsquo;<samp>include</samp>&rsquo; to the prefix.
</p>
<p>The runtime support file <samp>libgcc.a</samp> can also be searched for using
the <samp>-B</samp> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
</p>
<p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the <samp>-B</samp> prefix is to use
the environment variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.  See <a href="Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.
</p>
<p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by <samp>-B</samp> is
<samp>[dir/]stage<var>N</var>/</samp>, where <var>N</var> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by <samp>[dir/]include</samp>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-no-canonical-prefixes</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-no-canonical-prefixes"></a>
<p>Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to &lsquo;<samp>/../</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>/./</samp>&rsquo;, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--sysroot=<var>dir</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-sysroot"></a>
<p>Use <var>dir</var> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
<samp>/usr/include</samp> and libraries in <samp>/usr/lib</samp>, it instead
searches <samp><var>dir</var>/usr/include</samp> and <samp><var>dir</var>/usr/lib</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you use both this option and the <samp>-isysroot</samp> option, then
the <samp>--sysroot</samp> option applies to libraries, but the
<samp>-isysroot</samp> option applies to header files.
</p>
<p>The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <samp>--sysroot</samp> still works, but the
library aspect does not.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--no-sysroot-suffix</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-no-sysroot-suffix"></a>
<p>For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with <samp>--sysroot</samp>, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
<samp><var>dir</var>/<var>suffix</var>/usr/include</samp> instead of
<samp><var>dir</var>/usr/include</samp>.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.

<a name="Options-for-Code-Generation-Conventions"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.16 Options for Code Generation Conventions</h3>
<a name="index-code-generation-conventions"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-code-generation"></a>
<a name="index-run-time-options"></a>

<p>These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
</p>
<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <samp>-ffoo</samp> is <samp>-fno-foo</samp>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp>no-</samp>&rsquo; or adding
it.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fstack-reuse=<var>reuse-level</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack_005freuse"></a>
<p>This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  <var>reuse_level</var> can be &lsquo;<samp>all</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>named_vars</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo;. &lsquo;<samp>all</samp>&rsquo; enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, &lsquo;<samp>named_vars</samp>&rsquo; enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo; disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is &lsquo;<samp>all</samp>&rsquo;. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">   int *p;
   {
     int local1;

     p = &amp;local1;
     local1 = 10;
     ....
   }
   {
      int local2;
      local2 = 20;
      ...
   }

   if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
     {

     }
</pre></div>

<p>Another example:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">

   struct A
   {
       A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
       int i;
       int j;
   };

   A *ap;

   void foo(const A&amp; ar)
   {
      ap = &amp;ar;
   }

   void bar()
   {
      foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns

      {
        A a(20);
        ....
      }
      ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                   // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
   }

</pre></div>

<p>The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries&rsquo; stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftrapv</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftrapv"></a>
<p>This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
The options <samp>-ftrapv</samp> and <samp>-fwrapv</samp> override each other, so using
<samp>-ftrapv</samp> <samp>-fwrapv</samp> on the command-line results in
<samp>-fwrapv</samp> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using <samp>-ftrapv</samp> <samp>-fwrapv</samp> <samp>-fno-wrapv</samp> on the command-line
results in <samp>-ftrapv</samp> being effective.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fwrapv</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fwrapv"></a>
<p>This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.
The options <samp>-ftrapv</samp> and <samp>-fwrapv</samp> override each other, so using
<samp>-ftrapv</samp> <samp>-fwrapv</samp> on the command-line results in
<samp>-fwrapv</samp> being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using <samp>-ftrapv</samp> <samp>-fwrapv</samp> <samp>-fno-wrapv</samp> on the command-line
results in <samp>-ftrapv</samp> being effective.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fwrapv-pointer</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fwrapv-pointer"></a>
<p>This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer arithmetic
overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around using twos-complement
representation.  This flag disables some optimizations which assume
pointer overflow is invalid.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstrict-overflow</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict-overflow"></a>
<p>This option implies <samp>-fno-wrapv</samp> <samp>-fno-wrapv-pointer</samp> and when
negated implies <samp>-fwrapv</samp> <samp>-fwrapv-pointer</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fexceptions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fexceptions"></a>
<p>Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC enables it by default for languages like
C++ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don&rsquo;t
use exception handling.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnon-call-exceptions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fnon-call-exceptions"></a>
<p>Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <em>trapping</em>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <code>SIGALRM</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdelete-dead-exceptions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdelete-dead-exceptions"></a>
<p>Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don&rsquo;t otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funwind-tables</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funwind-tables"></a>
<p>Similar to <samp>-fexceptions</samp>, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fasynchronous-unwind-tables"></a>
<p>Generate unwind table in DWARF format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-gnu-unique</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-gnu-unique"></a>
<p>On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++ compiler
uses the <code>STB_GNU_UNIQUE</code> binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of <code>RTLD_LOCAL</code>; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
<code>RTLD_LOCAL</code> plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes <code>dlclose</code> to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via
<code>dlclose</code> and <code>dlopen</code>, you can use
<samp>-fno-gnu-unique</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpcc-struct-return</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpcc-struct-return"></a>
<p>Return &ldquo;short&rdquo; <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
</p>
<p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.
</p>
<p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<samp>-freg-struct-return</samp> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-freg-struct-return</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-freg-struct-return"></a>
<p>Return <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you specify neither <samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp> nor
<samp>-freg-struct-return</samp>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <samp>-freg-struct-return</samp>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fshort-enums</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fshort-enums"></a>
<p>Allocate to an <code>enum</code> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <code>enum</code> type
is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp>-fshort-enums</samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fshort-wchar</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fshort-wchar"></a>
<p>Override the underlying type for <code>wchar_t</code> to be <code>short
unsigned int</code> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp>-fshort-wchar</samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-common</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-common"></a>
<a name="index-tentative-definitions"></a>
<p>In C code, this option controls the placement of global variables 
defined without an initializer, known as <em>tentative definitions</em> 
in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are distinct from declarations 
of a variable with the <code>extern</code> keyword, which do not allocate storage.
</p>
<p>Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This allows the
linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable
in different compilation units to the same object, or to a non-tentative
definition.  
This is the behavior specified by <samp>-fcommon</samp>, and is the default for 
GCC on most targets.  
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO
C, and on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
variable references.
</p>
<p>The <samp>-fno-common</samp> option specifies that the compiler should instead
place uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file.
This inhibits the merging of tentative definitions by the linker so
you get a multiple-definition error if the same 
variable is defined in more than one compilation unit.
Compiling with <samp>-fno-common</samp> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable definitions this way.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-ident</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-ident"></a>
<p>Ignore the <code>#ident</code> directive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finhibit-size-directive</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finhibit-size-directive"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t output a <code>.size</code> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <samp>crtstuff.c</samp>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fverbose-asm</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fverbose-asm"></a>
<p>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
</p>
<p><samp>-fno-verbose-asm</samp>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.
</p>
<p>The added comments include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> information on the compiler version and command-line options,

</li><li> the source code lines associated with the assembly instructions,
in the form FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF LINE,

</li><li> hints on which high-level expressions correspond to
the various assembly instruction operands.

</li></ul>

<p>For example, given this C source file:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int test (int n)
{
  int i;
  int total = 0;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
    total += i * i;

  return total;
}
</pre></div>

<p>compiling to (x86_64) assembly via <samp>-S</samp> and emitting the result
direct to stdout via <samp>-o</samp> <samp>-</samp>
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -S test.c -fverbose-asm -Os -o -
</pre></div>

<p>gives output similar to this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">	.file	&quot;test.c&quot;

<p>The comments are intended for humans rather than machines and hence the
precise format of the comments is subject to change.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-frecord-gcc-switches</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-frecord-gcc-switches"></a>
<p>This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the <samp>-fverbose-asm</samp> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also <samp>-grecord-gcc-switches</samp> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpic"></a>
<a name="index-global-offset-table"></a>
<a name="index-PIC"></a>
<p>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<samp>-fpic</samp> does not work; in that case, recompile with <samp>-fPIC</samp>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC, 28k on AArch64 and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)
</p>
<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the x86, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.
</p>
<p>When this flag is set, the macros <code>__pic__</code> and <code>__PIC__</code>
are defined to 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fPIC</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fPIC"></a>
<p>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on AArch64, m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC.
</p>
<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.
</p>
<p>When this flag is set, the macros <code>__pic__</code> and <code>__PIC__</code>
are defined to 2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpie</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fPIE</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpie"></a>
<a name="index-fPIE"></a>
<p>These options are similar to <samp>-fpic</samp> and <samp>-fPIC</samp>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when <samp>-pie</samp> GCC option is
used during linking.
</p>
<p><samp>-fpie</samp> and <samp>-fPIE</samp> both define the macros
<code>__pie__</code> and <code>__PIE__</code>.  The macros have the value 1
for <samp>-fpie</samp> and 2 for <samp>-fPIE</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-plt</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-plt"></a>
<p>Do not use the PLT for external function calls in position-independent code.
Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the GOT and branch to it.
This leads to more efficient code by eliminating PLT stubs and exposing
GOT loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32-bit x86 where
PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a specific register, this gives more
register allocation freedom to the compiler.
Lazy binding requires use of the PLT; 
with <samp>-fno-plt</samp> all external symbols are resolved at load time.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the function attribute <code>noplt</code> can be used to avoid calls
through the PLT for specific external functions.
</p>
<p>In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-jump-tables</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno-jump-tables"></a>
<p>Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <samp>-fpic</samp> or <samp>-fPIC</samp> for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffixed-<var>reg</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffixed"></a>
<p>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).
</p>
<p><var>reg</var> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>
macro in the machine description macro file.
</p>
<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
</p>

</p>
<p>It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.

</p>
<p>A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for

</p>
<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a

</dd>
<dt><code>-fpack-struct[=<var>n</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpack-struct"></a>
<p>Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp>-fpack-struct</samp> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fleading-underscore</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fleading-underscore"></a>
<p>This option and its counterpart, <samp>-fno-leading-underscore</samp>, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <samp>-fleading-underscore</samp> switch causes GCC to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftls-model=<var>model</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftls-model"></a>
<p>Alter the thread-local storage model to be used (see <a href="Thread-Local.html#Thread-Local">Thread-Local</a>).
The <var>model</var> argument should be one of &lsquo;<samp>global-dynamic</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>local-dynamic</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>initial-exec</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>local-exec</samp>&rsquo;.
Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may use
a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation
unit, or if <samp>-fpic</samp> is not given on the command line.
</p>
<p>The default without <samp>-fpic</samp> is &lsquo;<samp>initial-exec</samp>&rsquo;; with
<samp>-fpic</samp> the default is &lsquo;<samp>global-dynamic</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftrampolines</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftrampolines"></a>
<p>For targets that normally need trampolines for nested functions, always
generate them instead of using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that
do not need them, like for example HP-PA or IA-64, do nothing.
</p>
<p>A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the
stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call
the nested function indirectly.  Therefore, it requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.
</p>
<p><samp>-fno-trampolines</samp> is enabled by default on a language by language
basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if it computes that this
is safe, and replace them with descriptors.  Descriptors are made up of data
only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of this
writing, <samp>-fno-trampolines</samp> is enabled by default only for Ada.
</p>
<p>Moreover, code compiled with <samp>-ftrampolines</samp> and code compiled with
<samp>-fno-trampolines</samp> are not binary compatible if nested functions are
present.  This option must therefore be used on a program-wide basis and be
manipulated with extreme care.

<dt><code>-fvisibility=<span class="roman">[</span>default<span class="roman">|</span>internal<span class="roman">|</span>hidden<span class="roman">|</span>protected<span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvisibility"></a>
<p>Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option&mdash;all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
</p>
<p>Despite the nomenclature, &lsquo;<samp>default</samp>&rsquo; always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
&lsquo;<samp>protected</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>internal</samp>&rsquo; are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is &lsquo;<samp>hidden</samp>&rsquo;.
The default if <samp>-fvisibility</samp> isn&rsquo;t specified is
&lsquo;<samp>default</samp>&rsquo;, i.e., make every symbol public.
</p>
<p>A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by &ldquo;How To Write
Shared Libraries&rdquo; by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</a><!-- /@w -->)&mdash;however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with <samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp>
and <code>__attribute__ ((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))</code> instead of
<code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
</p>
<p>For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<code>#pragma GCC visibility</code> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<code>#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)</code> and
<code>#pragma GCC visibility pop</code>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <strong>as
part of the API interface contract</strong> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should <strong>always</strong> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads&mdash;making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, <code>operator new</code> and
<code>operator delete</code> must always be of default visibility.
</p>
<p>Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <code>#pragma GCC visibility push(default)</code>
before including any such headers.
</p>
<p><code>extern</code> declarations are not affected by <samp>-fvisibility</samp>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <code>extern</code>
functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use <code>__attribute ((visibility))</code> and/or
<code>#pragma GCC visibility</code> to tell the compiler which <code>extern</code>
declarations should be treated as hidden.
</p>
<p>Note that <samp>-fvisibility</samp> does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the &lsquo;<samp>type_info</samp>&rsquo; nodes are unified between
the DSOs.
</p>
<p>An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict-volatile-bitfields"></a>
<p>This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field&rsquo;s type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as <code>unsigned short</code> (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.
</p>
<p>If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
</p>
<p>In some cases, such as when the <code>packed</code> attribute is applied to a 
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that 
will fault or truncate the result at run time.
</p>
<p>Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field&rsquo;s type as bit-field members.
</p>
<p>The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsync-libcalls</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsync-libcalls"></a>
<p>This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the <code>__sync</code>
family of functions may be used to implement the C++11 <code>__atomic</code>
family of functions.
</p>
<p>The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is <samp>-fno-sync-libcalls</samp>.  This option is used in
the implementation of the <samp>libatomic</samp> runtime library.

<p>This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps
at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as
memory use and execution time; and that print information about GCC&rsquo;s
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should
rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and
linking tasks.

<dd><a name="index-d-1"></a>
<a name="index-fdump-rtl-pass"></a>
<p>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<var>letters</var>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the <var>dumpname</var>, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file.  In case of
<samp>=<var>filename</var></samp> option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files.  Note that the pass number is
assigned as passes are registered into the pass manager.  Most passes
are registered in the order that they will execute and for these passes
the number corresponds to the pass execution order.  However, passes
registered by plugins, passes specific to compilation targets, or
passes that are otherwise registered after all the other passes are
numbered higher than a pass named &quot;final&quot;, even if they are executed
earlier.  <var>dumpname</var> is generated from the name of the output
file if explicitly specified and not an executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  
</p>
<p>Some <samp>-d<var>letters</var></samp> switches have different meaning when
<samp>-E</samp> is used for preprocessing.  See <a href="Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options">Preprocessor Options</a>,
for information about preprocessor-specific dump options.
</p>
<p>Debug dumps can be enabled with a <samp>-fdump-rtl</samp> switch or some
<samp>-d</samp> option <var>letters</var>.  Here are the possible

<p>To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass
of interest follow the steps below.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Invoke GCC with <samp>-fdump-passes</samp> and in the <samp>stderr</samp> output
look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in.
For example, the codes <code>tree-evrp</code>, <code>tree-vrp1</code>, and
<code>tree-vrp2</code> correspond to the three Value Range Propagation passes.
The number at the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.
</li><li> To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to
the <samp>-fdump-</samp> option prefix and invoke GCC with it.  For example,
to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke
GCC with the <samp>-fdump-tree-evrp</samp> option.  Optionally, you may
specify the name of the dump file.  If you don&rsquo;t specify one, GCC
creates as described below.
</li><li> Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components
separated by a period: the name of the source file GCC was invoked to
compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass number followed by the
letter &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; for tree passes (and the letter &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; for RTL passes),
and finally the pass code.  For example, the Early VRP pass dump might
be in a file named <samp>myfile.c.038t.evrp</samp> in the current working
directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change
from one version of GCC to another.

<p>Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
&lsquo;<samp>-<var>options</var></samp>&rsquo; form is used, <var>options</var> is a list of
&lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo; separated option keywords to select the dump details and
optimizations.  
</p>
<p>The <var>options</var> can be divided into two groups: options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the later options override the earlier options on the command
line. 
</p>
<p>The following options control the dump verbosity:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>optimized</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which are
successfully vectorized.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>missed</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output. 
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>note</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>all</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Print detailed optimization information. This includes
&lsquo;<samp>optimized</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>missed</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>note</samp>&rsquo;.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a
group of optimizations:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>ipa</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>loop</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>inline</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>omp</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all OMP (Offloading and Multi Processing) optimizations.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>vec</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.
</p></dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>optall</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of
the optimization groups listed above.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If <var>options</var> is
omitted, it defaults to &lsquo;<samp>optimized-optall</samp>&rsquo;, which means to dump all
info about successful optimizations from all the passes.  
</p>
<p>If the <var>filename</var> is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <var>filename</var>.
Otherwise the dump is output onto <samp>stderr</samp>. Though multiple
<samp>-fopt-info</samp> options are accepted, only one of them can include
a <var>filename</var>. If other filenames are provided then all but the
first such option are ignored.
</p>
<p>Note that the output <var>filename</var> is overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, <samp>stderr</samp> should be used
instead.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the optimization info is output to
<samp>stderr</samp>:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info
</pre></div>

<p>This example:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all
</pre></div>

<p>outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
<samp>missed.all</samp>, and this one:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed
</pre></div>

<p>prints information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on <samp>stderr</samp>.  
Note that <samp>-fopt-info-vec-missed</samp> is equivalent to 
<samp>-fopt-info-missed-vec</samp>.  The order of the optimization group
names and message types listed after <samp>-fopt-info</samp> does not matter.
</p>
<p>As another example,
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt
</pre></div>

<p>outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
<samp>inline.txt</samp>.
</p>
<p>Finally, consider:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt
</pre></div>

<p>Here the two output filenames <samp>vec.miss</samp> and <samp>loop.opt</samp> are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only <samp>vec.miss</samp> is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsched-verbose=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsched-verbose"></a>
<p>On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints to the dump files.
</p>
<p>For <var>n</var> greater than zero, <samp>-fsched-verbose</samp> outputs the
same information as <samp>-fdump-rtl-sched1</samp> and <samp>-fdump-rtl-sched2</samp>.
For <var>n</var> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For <var>n</var> greater
than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for <var>n</var> over four, <samp>-fsched-verbose</samp> also includes
dependence info.

<dt><code>-fchecking</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fchecking=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fchecking"></a>
<a name="index-fno-checking"></a>
<p>Enable internal consistency checking.  The default depends on
the compiler configuration.  <samp>-fchecking=2</samp> enables further
internal consistency checking that might affect code generation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-frandom-seed=<var>string</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-frandom-seed"></a>
<p>This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the <samp>-frandom-seed</samp> option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.
</p>
<p>The <var>string</var> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an
arbitrary string (in which case it&rsquo;s converted to a number by
computing CRC32).
</p>
<p>The <var>string</var> should be different for every file you compile.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-save-temps</code></dt>
<dt><code>-save-temps=cwd</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-save-temps"></a>
<p>Store the usual &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <samp>foo.c</samp> with <samp>-c -save-temps</samp> produces files
<samp>foo.i</samp> and <samp>foo.s</samp>, as well as <samp>foo.o</samp>.  This creates a
preprocessed <samp>foo.i</samp> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
</p>
<p>When used in combination with the <samp>-x</samp> command-line option,
<samp>-save-temps</samp> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <samp>-save-temps</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;
</pre></div>

<p>may result in <samp>foo.i</samp> and <samp>foo.o</samp> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-save-temps=obj</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-save-temps_003dobj"></a>
<p>Store the usual &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; intermediate files permanently.  If the
<samp>-o</samp> option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the <samp>-o</samp> option is not used, the
<samp>-save-temps=obj</samp> switch behaves like <samp>-save-temps</samp>.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar
</pre></div>

<p>creates <samp>foo.i</samp>, <samp>foo.s</samp>, <samp>dir/xbar.i</samp>,
<samp>dir/xbar.s</samp>, <samp>dir2/yfoobar.i</samp>, <samp>dir2/yfoobar.s</samp>, and
<samp>dir2/yfoobar.o</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-time<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-time"></a>
<p>Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).
</p>
<p>Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample"># cc1 0.12 0.01
# as 0.00 0.01
</pre></div>

<p>The first number on each line is the &ldquo;user time&rdquo;, that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is &ldquo;system time&rdquo;,
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
</p>
<p>With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">0.12 0.01 cc1 <var>options</var>
0.00 0.01 as <var>options</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The &ldquo;user time&rdquo; and the &ldquo;system time&rdquo; are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdump-final-insns<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>file</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdump-final-insns"></a>
<p>Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to <var>file</var>.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if <var>file</var> is <code>.</code>), the name
of the dump file is determined by appending <code>.gkd</code> to the
compilation output file name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcompare-debug<span class="roman">[</span>=<var>opts</var><span class="roman">]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcompare-debug"></a>
<a name="index-fno-compare-debug"></a>
<p>If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding <var>opts</var> and <samp>-fcompare-debug-second</samp> to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.
</p>
<p>If the equal sign is omitted, the default <samp>-gtoggle</samp> is used.
</p>
<p>The environment variable <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code>, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables <samp>-fcompare-debug</samp>.  If
<code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for <var>opts</var>, otherwise the default <samp>-gtoggle</samp>
is used.
</p>
<p><samp>-fcompare-debug=</samp>, with the equal sign but without <var>opts</var>,
is equivalent to <samp>-fno-compare-debug</samp>, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
<code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> from taking effect.
</p>
<p>To verify full coverage during <samp>-fcompare-debug</samp> testing, set
<code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> to say <samp>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</samp>,
which GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting <code>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</code> to &lsquo;<samp>-w%n-fcompare-debug
not overridden</samp>&rsquo; will do.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcompare-debug-second</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcompare-debug-second"></a>
<p>This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by <samp>-fcompare-debug</samp>, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
<code>.gk</code> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.
</p>
<p>When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
<em>first</em> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gtoggle</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-gtoggle"></a>
<p>Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
<samp>-fcompare-debug</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle"></a>
<a name="index-fno-var-tracking-assignments-toggle"></a>
<p>Toggle <samp>-fvar-tracking-assignments</samp>, in the same way that
<samp>-gtoggle</samp> toggles <samp>-g</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Q</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Q"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftime-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftime-report"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftime-report-details</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftime-report-details"></a>
<p>Record the time consumed by infrastructure parts separately for each pass.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fira-verbose=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fira-verbose"></a>
<p>Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value <var>n</var> is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as <var>n</var> minus 10.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto-report"></a>
<p>Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version.
It is meant to be useful to GCC developers when processing object
files in LTO mode (via <samp>-flto</samp>).
</p>
<p>Disabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto-report-wpa</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto-report-wpa"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-flto-report</samp>, but only print for the WPA phase of Link
Time Optimization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmem-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmem-report"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmem-report-wpa</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmem-report-wpa"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation for the WPA phase only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpre-ipa-mem-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpre-ipa-mem-report"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpost-ipa-mem-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpost-ipa-mem-report"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-report</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile-report"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of the
(estimated) profile and effect of individual passes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstack-usage</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack-usage"></a>
<p>Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
<samp>.su</samp> to the <var>auxname</var>.  <var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The name of the function.
</li><li> A number of bytes.
</li><li> One or more qualifiers: <code>static</code>, <code>dynamic</code>, <code>bounded</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>The qualifier <code>static</code> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
</p>
<p>The qualifier <code>dynamic</code> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier <code>bounded</code> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstats</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstats"></a>
<p>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This option is supported only by the C++ front end, and
the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fdbg-cnt-list</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdbg-cnt-list"></a>
<p>Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fdbg-cnt=<var>counter-value-list</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdbg-cnt"></a>
<p>Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  <var>counter-value-list</var>
is a comma-separated list of <var>name</var>:<var>value</var> pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter <var>name</var> to <var>value</var>.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of <code>UINT_MAX</code>;
thus <code>dbg_cnt</code> returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option.
For example, with <samp>-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0</samp>,
<code>dbg_cnt(dce)</code> returns true only for first 10 invocations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-file-name=<var>library</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-file-name"></a>
<p>Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that
would be used when linking&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-directory</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-multi-directory"></a>
<p>Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-lib</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-multi-lib"></a>
<p>Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
&lsquo;<samp>;</samp>&rsquo;, and each switch starts with an &lsquo;<samp>@</samp>&rsquo; instead of the
&lsquo;<samp>-</samp>&rsquo;, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-multi-os-directory</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-multi-os-directory"></a>
<p>Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some <samp>lib</samp> subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the <samp>lib</samp> subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just <samp>.</samp>, if OS libraries are present in <samp>lib<var>suffix</var></samp>
sibling directories this prints e.g. <samp>../lib64</samp>, <samp>../lib</samp> or
<samp>../lib32</samp>, or if OS libraries are present in <samp>lib/<var>subdir</var></samp>
subdirectories it prints e.g. <samp>amd64</samp>, <samp>sparcv9</samp> or <samp>ev6</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-multiarch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-multiarch"></a>
<p>Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some <samp>lib</samp> subdirectory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-prog-name=<var>program</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-prog-name"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-print-file-name</samp>, but searches for a program such as <code>cpp</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-libgcc-file-name</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-libgcc-file-name"></a>
<p>Same as <samp>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</samp>.
</p>
<p>This is useful when you use <samp>-nostdlib</samp> or <samp>-nodefaultlibs</samp>
but you do want to link with <samp>libgcc.a</samp>.  You can do:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var>&hellip; `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-search-dirs"></a>
<p>Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories <code>gcc</code> searches&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do anything else.
</p>
<p>This is useful when <code>gcc</code> prints the error message
&lsquo;<samp>installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</samp>&rsquo;.
To resolve this you either need to put <samp>cpp0</samp> and the other compiler
components where <code>gcc</code> expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <code>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</code> to the directory where you installed them.
Don&rsquo;t forget the trailing &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;.
See <a href="Environment-Variables.html#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-sysroot</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-sysroot"></a>
<p>Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the <samp>--sysroot</samp> option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print-sysroot-headers-suffix"></a>
<p>Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do anything else.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dumpmachine</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dumpmachine"></a>
<p>Print the compiler&rsquo;s target machine (for example,
&lsquo;<samp>i686-pc-linux-gnu</samp>&rsquo;)&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do anything else.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dumpversion</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dumpversion"></a>
<p>Print the compiler version (for example, <code>3.0</code>, <code>6.3.0</code> or <code>7</code>)&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do
anything else.  This is the compiler version used in filesystem paths,
specs, can be depending on how the compiler has been configured just
a single number (major version), two numbers separated by dot (major and
minor version) or three numbers separated by dots (major, minor and patchlevel
version).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dumpfullversion</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dumpfullversion"></a>
<p>Print the full compiler version, always 3 numbers separated by dots,
major, minor and patchlevel version.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-dumpspecs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-dumpspecs"></a>
<p>Print the compiler&rsquo;s built-in specs&mdash;and don&rsquo;t do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)  See <a href="Spec-Files.html#Spec-Files">Spec Files</a>.

<p>Each target machine supported by GCC can have its own options&mdash;for

convention, the names of machine-specific options start with
&lsquo;<samp>-m</samp>&rsquo;.
